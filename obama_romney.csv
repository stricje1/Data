OBAMA,4.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe."
OBAMA,4.1,time 3,candidate,"Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for forty years."
OBAMA,4.11,time 3,candidate,"Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend."
OBAMA,4.12,time 3,candidate,We stand with them.
OBAMA,4.13,time 3,candidate,Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.
OBAMA,4.14,time 3,candidate,"And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East."
OBAMA,4.2,time 3,candidate,And that's what we've done over the last four years.
OBAMA,4.3,time 3,candidate,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on nine/eleven."
OBAMA,4.4,time 3,candidate,"And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated."
OBAMA,4.5,time 3,candidate,"In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security."
OBAMA,4.6,time 3,candidate,And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.
OBAMA,4.7,time 3,candidate,"Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice."
OBAMA,4.8,time 3,candidate,And that's exactly what we're going to do.
OBAMA,4.9,time 3,candidate,But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.
OBAMA,5.1,time 1,candidate,"Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it."
OBAMA,5.1,time 1,candidate,And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
OBAMA,5.11,time 1,candidate,One last point I want to make.
OBAMA,5.12,time 1,candidate,"We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid|"
OBAMA,5.2,time 1,candidate,And private insurers have to make a profit.
OBAMA,5.3,time 1,candidate,Nothing wrong with that.
OBAMA,5.4,time 1,candidate,That's what they do.
OBAMA,5.5,time 1,candidate,"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that."
OBAMA,5.6,time 1,candidate,"And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere."
OBAMA,5.7,time 1,candidate,"And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies."
OBAMA,5.8,time 1,candidate,"And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck."
OBAMA,5.9,time 1,candidate,And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.
OBAMA,7.1,time 1,candidate,but but but overall.
OBAMA,7.1,time 2,candidate,"Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright."
OBAMA,7.1,time 2,candidate,Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.
OBAMA,7.1,time 3,candidate,"Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the one thousand nine hundred eightys, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for twenty years."
OBAMA,7.1,time 3,candidate,Then you said we should.
OBAMA,7.11,time 2,candidate,I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.
OBAMA,7.11,time 3,candidate,"Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies."
OBAMA,7.12,time 2,candidate,"I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here."
OBAMA,7.12,time 3,candidate,"So, what what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map."
OBAMA,7.13,time 2,candidate,It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.
OBAMA,7.13,time 3,candidate,"And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul."
OBAMA,7.14,time 2,candidate,"Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world."
OBAMA,7.15,time 2,candidate,"And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future."
OBAMA,7.16,time 2,candidate,"Number three, we've got to control our own energy."
OBAMA,7.17,time 2,candidate,"Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, twenty years from now."
OBAMA,7.18,time 2,candidate,"That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars."
OBAMA,7.19,time 2,candidate,"We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way."
OBAMA,7.2,time 2,candidate,And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.
OBAMA,7.2,time 2,candidate,Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.
OBAMA,7.2,time 3,candidate,"But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the one thousand nine hundred eightys, just like the social policies of the one thousand nine hundred fiftys and the economic policies of the one thousand nine hundred twentys."
OBAMA,7.21,time 2,candidate,"And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools."
OBAMA,7.22,time 2,candidate,"We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well."
OBAMA,7.3,time 2,candidate,"Not just to you, but to the entire nation."
OBAMA,7.3,time 3,candidate,You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.
OBAMA,7.4,time 2,candidate,"Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country."
OBAMA,7.4,time 3,candidate,"But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now."
OBAMA,7.5,time 2,candidate,"But not just jobs, good paying jobs."
OBAMA,7.5,time 3,candidate,"And the the challenge we have I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong."
OBAMA,7.6,time 2,candidate,Ones that can support a family.
OBAMA,7.6,time 3,candidate,"You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction."
OBAMA,7.7,time 2,candidate,"And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last thirty months in the private sector alone."
OBAMA,7.7,time 3,candidate,You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.
OBAMA,7.8,time 2,candidate,And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.
OBAMA,7.8,time 3,candidate,"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that seventy one senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it."
OBAMA,7.9,time 2,candidate,"Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again."
OBAMA,7.9,time 3,candidate,"You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan."
OBAMA,9.1,time 1,candidate,And so|
OBAMA,10.1,time 3,candidate,What I would not have had done was left ten thousand troops in Iraq that would tie us down.
OBAMA,10.2,time 3,candidate,And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.
OBAMA,11.1,time 1,candidate,Is that a is that a separate topic?
OBAMA,11.1,time 2,candidate,"Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true."
OBAMA,11.1,time 2,candidate,"That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate."
OBAMA,11.11,time 2,candidate,You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.
OBAMA,11.12,time 2,candidate,You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.
OBAMA,11.13,time 2,candidate,"You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money."
OBAMA,11.14,time 2,candidate,That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.
OBAMA,11.15,time 2,candidate,That's what's been squeezing middle class families.
OBAMA,11.16,time 2,candidate,And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.
OBAMA,11.17,time 2,candidate,The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.
OBAMA,11.2,time 2,candidate,He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.
OBAMA,11.3,time 2,candidate,And we would have lost a million jobs.
OBAMA,11.4,time 2,candidate,"And that don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney."
OBAMA,11.5,time 2,candidate,But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.
OBAMA,11.6,time 2,candidate,And Governor Romney's says he's got a five point plan?
OBAMA,11.7,time 2,candidate,Governor Romney doesn't have a five point plan.
OBAMA,11.8,time 2,candidate,He has a one point plan.
OBAMA,11.9,time 2,candidate,And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.
OBAMA,12.1,time 3,candidate,Governor|
OBAMA,13.1,time 1,candidate,I'm sorry.
OBAMA,14.1,time 3,candidate,Governor?
OBAMA,16.1,time 3,candidate,This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.
OBAMA,18.1,time 3,candidate,You you|
OBAMA,20.1,time 2,candidate,The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.
OBAMA,20.1,time 2,candidate,That's why we doubled clean clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.
OBAMA,20.1,time 3,candidate,major speech.
OBAMA,20.11,time 2,candidate,And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in sixteen years.
OBAMA,20.12,time 2,candidate,"Now, I want to build on that."
OBAMA,20.13,time 2,candidate,"And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling."
OBAMA,20.14,time 2,candidate,We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.
OBAMA,20.15,time 2,candidate,We've got potentially six hundred thousand jobs and one hundred years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.
OBAMA,20.16,time 2,candidate,And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.
OBAMA,20.17,time 2,candidate,"But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower."
OBAMA,20.18,time 2,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all of the above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies."
OBAMA,20.19,time 2,candidate,"So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part."
OBAMA,20.2,time 2,candidate,So here's what I've done since I've been president.
OBAMA,20.2,time 2,candidate,"And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about ten years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future."
OBAMA,20.21,time 2,candidate,"Because China, Germany, they're making these investments."
OBAMA,20.22,time 2,candidate,And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.
OBAMA,20.23,time 2,candidate,I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.
OBAMA,20.24,time 2,candidate,That's going to help Jeremy get a job.
OBAMA,20.25,time 2,candidate,It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.
OBAMA,20.3,time 2,candidate,We have increased oil production to the highest levels in sixteen years.
OBAMA,20.4,time 2,candidate,Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.
OBAMA,20.5,time 2,candidate,We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.
OBAMA,20.6,time 2,candidate,But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.
OBAMA,20.7,time 2,candidate,We've also got to look to the future.
OBAMA,20.8,time 2,candidate,That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.
OBAMA,20.9,time 2,candidate,"That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas."
OBAMA,22.1,time 3,candidate,Governor?
OBAMA,24.1,time 2,candidate,"Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently."
OBAMA,24.1,time 2,candidate,"With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter."
OBAMA,24.1,time 3,candidate,Governor here here's here's one thing|
OBAMA,24.11,time 2,candidate,"Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas."
OBAMA,24.12,time 2,candidate,And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in twenty years.
OBAMA,24.13,time 2,candidate,"Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient."
OBAMA,24.14,time 2,candidate,And that's creating jobs.
OBAMA,24.15,time 2,candidate,"That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook."
OBAMA,24.16,time 2,candidate,"That's the strategy you need, an all of the above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years."
OBAMA,24.2,time 2,candidate,And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.
OBAMA,24.2,time 3,candidate,here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.
OBAMA,24.3,time 2,candidate,We've opened up public lands.
OBAMA,24.4,time 2,candidate,We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my the previous president was an oil man.
OBAMA,24.5,time 2,candidate,And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.
OBAMA,24.6,time 2,candidate,We're encouraging it and working with the industry.
OBAMA,24.7,time 2,candidate,"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, This plant kills, and took great pride in shutting it down."
OBAMA,24.8,time 2,candidate,And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.
OBAMA,24.9,time 2,candidate,So what I've tried to do is be consistent.
OBAMA,26.1,time 1,candidate,Absolutely.
OBAMA,26.1,time 2,candidate,"Not true, Governor Romney."
OBAMA,26.1,time 3,candidate,"You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean."
OBAMA,26.1,time 3,candidate,Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.
OBAMA,26.11,time 3,candidate,That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.
OBAMA,26.2,time 3,candidate,You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.
OBAMA,26.3,time 3,candidate,That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.
OBAMA,26.4,time 3,candidate,"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily."
OBAMA,26.5,time 3,candidate,"And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts."
OBAMA,26.6,time 3,candidate,"Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region."
OBAMA,26.7,time 3,candidate,"Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing."
OBAMA,26.8,time 3,candidate,"Number four, we do have to develop their economic their economic capabilities."
OBAMA,26.9,time 3,candidate,"But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions."
OBAMA,28.1,time 2,candidate,Not true.
OBAMA,28.1,time 3,candidate,"What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go."
OBAMA,28.1,time 3,candidate,"But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term."
OBAMA,28.2,time 3,candidate,We've mobilized sanctions against that government.
OBAMA,28.3,time 3,candidate,We have made sure that they are isolated.
OBAMA,28.4,time 3,candidate,"We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria."
OBAMA,28.5,time 3,candidate,"But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future."
OBAMA,28.6,time 3,candidate,"And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this."
OBAMA,28.7,time 3,candidate,"This what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition."
OBAMA,28.8,time 3,candidate,"But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region."
OBAMA,28.9,time 3,candidate,And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.
OBAMA,30.1,time 2,candidate,"Governor, we have actually produced more oil."
OBAMA,32.1,time 2,candidate,"Governor Romney, here's what we did."
OBAMA,32.2,time 2,candidate,There were a whole bunch of oil companies.
OBAMA,33.1,time 3,candidate,We are playing the leadership role.
OBAMA,33.1,time 3,candidate,Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.
OBAMA,33.11,time 3,candidate,"You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden."
OBAMA,33.12,time 3,candidate,And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.
OBAMA,33.13,time 3,candidate,That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.
OBAMA,33.14,time 3,candidate,"But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria."
OBAMA,33.15,time 3,candidate,That's exactly what we're doing.
OBAMA,33.2,time 3,candidate,We organized the Friends of Syria.
OBAMA,33.3,time 3,candidate,"We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition."
OBAMA,33.4,time 3,candidate,And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.
OBAMA,33.5,time 3,candidate,But going back to Libya because this is an example of how we make choices.
OBAMA,33.6,time 3,candidate,"When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize."
OBAMA,33.7,time 3,candidate,We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.
OBAMA,33.8,time 3,candidate,"And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized."
OBAMA,33.9,time 3,candidate,"But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle."
OBAMA,34.1,time 2,candidate,You want me to answer a question?
OBAMA,36.1,time 2,candidate,I'm happy to answer the question.
OBAMA,38.1,time 1,candidate,I think this is a great example.
OBAMA,38.1,time 1,candidate,"We said you've got banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements."
OBAMA,38.1,time 2,candidate,Here's what happened.
OBAMA,38.11,time 1,candidate,You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.
OBAMA,38.12,time 1,candidate,We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.
OBAMA,38.13,time 1,candidate,"In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest."
OBAMA,38.14,time 1,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd Frank."
OBAMA,38.15,time 1,candidate,"And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation."
OBAMA,38.16,time 1,candidate,"But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back."
OBAMA,38.17,time 1,candidate,And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?
OBAMA,38.18,time 1,candidate,"Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate."
OBAMA,38.19,time 1,candidate,But that's not what I believe.
OBAMA,38.2,time 1,candidate,The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.
OBAMA,38.2,time 2,candidate,You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.
OBAMA,38.3,time 1,candidate,"Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street."
OBAMA,38.3,time 2,candidate,"So what we said was you can't just sit on this for ten, twenty, thirty years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you."
OBAMA,38.4,time 1,candidate,"You had loan officers were that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify."
OBAMA,38.4,time 2,candidate,These are public lands.
OBAMA,38.5,time 1,candidate,You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.
OBAMA,38.5,time 2,candidate,"So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it."
OBAMA,38.6,time 1,candidate,You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone great investments when they weren't.
OBAMA,38.7,time 1,candidate,"But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable."
OBAMA,38.8,time 1,candidate,So what did we do?
OBAMA,38.9,time 1,candidate,We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the one thousand nine hundred thirtys.
OBAMA,39.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, I'll I'll be very quick."
OBAMA,39.2,time 3,candidate,What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas.
OBAMA,39.3,time 3,candidate,And that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a an effective transition so that we get Assad out.
OBAMA,39.4,time 3,candidate,That's the kind of leadership we've shown.
OBAMA,39.5,time 3,candidate,That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.
OBAMA,40.1,time 2,candidate,And so what we did was take away those leases.
OBAMA,40.2,time 2,candidate,And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.
OBAMA,41.1,time 3,candidate,Right.
OBAMA,42.1,time 2,candidate,Production is up.
OBAMA,43.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about."
OBAMA,43.1,time 1,candidate,You keep your own insurance.
OBAMA,43.1,time 3,candidate,"No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy."
OBAMA,43.1,time 3,candidate,"And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities."
OBAMA,43.11,time 1,candidate,You keep your own doctor.
OBAMA,43.11,time 3,candidate,Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.
OBAMA,43.12,time 1,candidate,But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.
OBAMA,43.12,time 3,candidate,"They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school."
OBAMA,43.13,time 1,candidate,They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.
OBAMA,43.13,time 3,candidate,They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.
OBAMA,43.14,time 1,candidate,They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance your insurance plan until you're twenty six years old.
OBAMA,43.14,time 3,candidate,"And so one of the things that we've been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent."
OBAMA,43.15,time 1,candidate,And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.
OBAMA,43.15,time 3,candidate,"But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well."
OBAMA,43.16,time 1,candidate,"Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market."
OBAMA,43.16,time 3,candidate,"You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system."
OBAMA,43.17,time 1,candidate,"Now, the last point I'd make before|"
OBAMA,43.17,time 3,candidate,And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do|
OBAMA,43.2,time 1,candidate,And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.
OBAMA,43.2,time 3,candidate,"The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F."
OBAMA,43.3,time 1,candidate,"It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country."
OBAMA,43.3,time 3,candidate,Kennedy talked about fifty years ago.
OBAMA,43.4,time 1,candidate,"If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all."
OBAMA,43.4,time 3,candidate,"But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities."
OBAMA,43.5,time 1,candidate,"If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit."
OBAMA,43.5,time 3,candidate,"And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region."
OBAMA,43.6,time 1,candidate,"And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit."
OBAMA,43.6,time 3,candidate,These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.
OBAMA,43.7,time 1,candidate,"So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle class families are secure in this country."
OBAMA,43.7,time 3,candidate,They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.
OBAMA,43.8,time 1,candidate,And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.
OBAMA,43.8,time 3,candidate,"That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels."
OBAMA,43.9,time 1,candidate,"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover."
OBAMA,43.9,time 3,candidate,They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.
OBAMA,44.1,time 2,candidate,"No, it isn't."
OBAMA,45.1,time 1,candidate,"No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there."
OBAMA,45.2,time 1,candidate,It hasn't destroyed jobs.
OBAMA,45.3,time 1,candidate,"And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold."
OBAMA,46.1,time 2,candidate,Governor.
OBAMA,48.1,time 1,candidate,Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.
OBAMA,48.1,time 1,candidate,And there are ways of doing it.
OBAMA,48.1,time 2,candidate,It's just not true.
OBAMA,48.11,time 1,candidate,"So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average."
OBAMA,48.12,time 1,candidate,And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.
OBAMA,48.13,time 1,candidate,"They they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with ten tests."
OBAMA,48.14,time 1,candidate,Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.
OBAMA,48.15,time 1,candidate,Let's let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've they've engaged in.
OBAMA,48.16,time 1,candidate,"Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do."
OBAMA,48.17,time 1,candidate,"And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down."
OBAMA,48.18,time 1,candidate,"And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up it's true but they've gone up slower than any time in the last fifty years."
OBAMA,48.19,time 1,candidate,So we're already beginning to see progress.
OBAMA,48.2,time 1,candidate,This was a bipartisan idea.
OBAMA,48.2,time 1,candidate,"In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate."
OBAMA,48.21,time 1,candidate,Let me make one last point.
OBAMA,48.22,time 1,candidate,"Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but but we can replace it with something."
OBAMA,48.23,time 1,candidate,"But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states."
OBAMA,48.24,time 1,candidate,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre existing condition be able to finally buy insurance."
OBAMA,48.25,time 1,candidate,"In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at fifty million people losing health insurance|"
OBAMA,48.3,time 1,candidate,"In fact, it was a Republican idea."
OBAMA,48.4,time 1,candidate,And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.
OBAMA,48.5,time 1,candidate,"And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan."
OBAMA,48.6,time 1,candidate,"It when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?"
OBAMA,48.7,time 1,candidate,Because there there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.
OBAMA,48.8,time 1,candidate,"One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line."
OBAMA,48.9,time 1,candidate,"Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?"
OBAMA,50.1,time 1,candidate,at a time when it's vitally important.
OBAMA,50.1,time 2,candidate,Well|
OBAMA,51.1,time 3,candidate,America remains the one indispensable nation.
OBAMA,51.1,time 3,candidate,We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.
OBAMA,51.11,time 3,candidate,But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by two thousand twenty.
OBAMA,51.12,time 3,candidate,That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.
OBAMA,51.13,time 3,candidate,And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.
OBAMA,51.14,time 3,candidate,"Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it."
OBAMA,51.15,time 3,candidate,"We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more."
OBAMA,51.16,time 3,candidate,That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.
OBAMA,51.17,time 3,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign."
OBAMA,51.18,time 3,candidate,"Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies."
OBAMA,51.19,time 3,candidate,He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's who shows great wisdom and judgment.
OBAMA,51.2,time 3,candidate,"And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office."
OBAMA,51.2,time 3,candidate,And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the twenty onest century.
OBAMA,51.3,time 3,candidate,"Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan."
OBAMA,51.4,time 3,candidate,It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.
OBAMA,51.5,time 3,candidate,"And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat."
OBAMA,51.6,time 3,candidate,"But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does."
OBAMA,51.7,time 3,candidate,"Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas."
OBAMA,51.8,time 3,candidate,"Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow."
OBAMA,51.9,time 3,candidate,Doing everything we can to control our own energy.
OBAMA,52.1,time 2,candidate,.
OBAMA,54.1,time 2,candidate,OK.
OBAMA,54.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, let's talk about what we need to compete."
OBAMA,54.1,time 3,candidate,We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.
OBAMA,54.11,time 3,candidate,And they're starting to finally make progress.
OBAMA,54.12,time 3,candidate,"And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science."
OBAMA,54.13,time 3,candidate,And those teachers can make a difference.
OBAMA,54.14,time 3,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow."
OBAMA,54.15,time 3,candidate,"When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference."
OBAMA,54.16,time 3,candidate,"But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference."
OBAMA,54.17,time 3,candidate,"And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here."
OBAMA,54.18,time 3,candidate,Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.
OBAMA,54.19,time 3,candidate,"And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long term competitiveness."
OBAMA,54.2,time 3,candidate,"First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses."
OBAMA,54.2,time 3,candidate,"That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices."
OBAMA,54.3,time 3,candidate,"But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about forty eightth, I think out of fifty states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses."
OBAMA,54.4,time 3,candidate,And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top.
OBAMA,54.5,time 3,candidate,And they include you and me.
OBAMA,54.6,time 3,candidate,That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.
OBAMA,54.7,time 3,candidate,But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the twenty onest century and that's our education policy.
OBAMA,54.8,time 3,candidate,We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.
OBAMA,54.9,time 3,candidate,"You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, forty six states."
OBAMA,55.1,time 1,candidate,Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.
OBAMA,55.1,time 1,candidate,"But what it does say is that insurers, you've got to take everybody."
OBAMA,55.11,time 1,candidate,"Now, that also means that you've got more customers."
OBAMA,55.12,time 1,candidate,"But when when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem."
OBAMA,55.13,time 1,candidate,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan."
OBAMA,55.14,time 1,candidate,"That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details."
OBAMA,55.15,time 1,candidate,"He says that he's going to replace Dodd Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones."
OBAMA,55.16,time 1,candidate,He won't tell us.
OBAMA,55.17,time 1,candidate,He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.
OBAMA,55.18,time 1,candidate,"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?"
OBAMA,55.19,time 1,candidate,Is it is it because that somehow middle class families are going to benefit too much from them?
OBAMA,55.2,time 1,candidate,That's explicitly prohibited in the law.
OBAMA,55.2,time 1,candidate,No.
OBAMA,55.21,time 1,candidate,"The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices."
OBAMA,55.22,time 1,candidate,And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle class families all across the country.
OBAMA,55.3,time 1,candidate,"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions."
OBAMA,55.4,time 1,candidate,"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does."
OBAMA,55.5,time 1,candidate,"What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've if it's been under ninety days."
OBAMA,55.6,time 1,candidate,But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.
OBAMA,55.7,time 1,candidate,There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.
OBAMA,55.8,time 1,candidate,It wasn't a government takeover of health care.
OBAMA,55.9,time 1,candidate,It was the largest expansion of private insurance.
OBAMA,57.1,time 2,candidate,"Well, think about what the governor think about what the governor just said."
OBAMA,57.1,time 2,candidate,"So, I'm all for pipelines."
OBAMA,57.11,time 2,candidate,I'm all for oil production.
OBAMA,57.12,time 2,candidate,What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.
OBAMA,57.13,time 2,candidate,"So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs."
OBAMA,57.14,time 2,candidate,"When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed."
OBAMA,57.15,time 2,candidate,I'd get rid of it.
OBAMA,57.16,time 2,candidate,That's not an energy strategy for the future.
OBAMA,57.17,time 2,candidate,And we need to win that future.
OBAMA,57.18,time 2,candidate,And I intend to win it as President of the United States.
OBAMA,57.2,time 2,candidate,"He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was dollar one."
OBAMA,57.3,time 2,candidate,"eighty, dollar one."
OBAMA,57.4,time 2,candidate,eighty six.
OBAMA,57.5,time 2,candidate,Why is that?
OBAMA,57.6,time 2,candidate,"Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting."
OBAMA,57.7,time 2,candidate,"So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess."
OBAMA,57.8,time 2,candidate,"What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy."
OBAMA,57.9,time 2,candidate,"And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once."
OBAMA,61.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, I definitely think there are differences."
OBAMA,61.1,time 3,candidate,Ten years earlier|
OBAMA,63.1,time 1,candidate,The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.
OBAMA,63.1,time 1,candidate,And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.
OBAMA,63.1,time 3,candidate,But that was ten years before you took office.
OBAMA,63.11,time 1,candidate,And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.
OBAMA,63.12,time 1,candidate,We use something called Race to the Top.
OBAMA,63.13,time 1,candidate,"Wasn't a top down approach, Governor."
OBAMA,63.14,time 1,candidate,"What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate refor Miss And as a consequence, you had forty six states around the country who have made a real difference."
OBAMA,63.15,time 1,candidate,But what I've also said is let's hire another one hundred thousand math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.
OBAMA,63.16,time 1,candidate,And hard pressed states right now can't all do that.
OBAMA,63.17,time 1,candidate,"In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers."
OBAMA,63.18,time 1,candidate,"I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help."
OBAMA,63.19,time 1,candidate,"It can't do it all, but it can make a difference."
OBAMA,63.2,time 1,candidate,That's its most basic function.
OBAMA,63.2,time 1,candidate,And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.
OBAMA,63.3,time 1,candidate,"And as commander in chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office."
OBAMA,63.4,time 1,candidate,"But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed."
OBAMA,63.5,time 1,candidate,"Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions."
OBAMA,63.6,time 1,candidate,"But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together."
OBAMA,63.7,time 1,candidate,"So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off."
OBAMA,63.8,time 1,candidate,That doesn't restrict people's freedom.
OBAMA,63.9,time 1,candidate,That enhances it.
OBAMA,67.1,time 3,candidate,That happened before you came into office.
OBAMA,71.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play."
OBAMA,71.2,time 1,candidate,"Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now."
OBAMA,72.1,time 2,candidate,"Candy, it's not going to|"
OBAMA,73.1,time 1,candidate,"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices."
OBAMA,73.2,time 1,candidate,"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference."
OBAMA,73.3,time 1,candidate,"You know, his his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about."
OBAMA,73.4,time 1,candidate,And it wasn't very detailed.
OBAMA,73.5,time 1,candidate,This seems to be a trend.
OBAMA,73.6,time 1,candidate,"But but what it did do is to if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to twenty percent."
OBAMA,73.7,time 1,candidate,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now."
OBAMA,73.8,time 1,candidate,And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training progra Miss |
OBAMA,74.1,time 2,candidate,Used to being interrupted.
OBAMA,75.1,time 1,candidate,Let me just finish the point.
OBAMA,75.1,time 1,candidate,"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option."
OBAMA,75.1,time 3,candidate,He should have answered the first question.
OBAMA,75.1,time 3,candidate,"But, what you can't do is spend dollar two trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, dollar five trillion on tax cuts."
OBAMA,75.11,time 1,candidate,"And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids."
OBAMA,75.11,time 3,candidate,"You say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are."
OBAMA,75.12,time 1,candidate,It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.
OBAMA,75.12,time 3,candidate,And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.
OBAMA,75.13,time 3,candidate,The math simply doesn't work.
OBAMA,75.14,time 3,candidate,"But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities."
OBAMA,75.15,time 3,candidate,We need to be thinking about cyber security.
OBAMA,75.16,time 3,candidate,We need to be talking about space.
OBAMA,75.17,time 3,candidate,"That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy."
OBAMA,75.18,time 3,candidate,It's not driven by politics.
OBAMA,75.19,time 3,candidate,"It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see."
OBAMA,75.2,time 1,candidate,The where they're partnering so that they're designing training progra Miss And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.
OBAMA,75.2,time 3,candidate,"Look, Governor Romney's called for dollar five trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions."
OBAMA,75.2,time 3,candidate,"It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?"
OBAMA,75.21,time 3,candidate,"That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern."
OBAMA,75.22,time 3,candidate,Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.
OBAMA,75.3,time 1,candidate,"That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support."
OBAMA,75.3,time 3,candidate,"Now, the math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's going to do it."
OBAMA,75.4,time 1,candidate,Let me just say one final example.
OBAMA,75.4,time 3,candidate,He then wants to spend another dollar two trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.
OBAMA,75.5,time 1,candidate,"When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two year or four year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending dollar sixty billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed."
OBAMA,75.5,time 3,candidate,"Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office."
OBAMA,75.6,time 1,candidate,"So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system."
OBAMA,75.6,time 3,candidate,"We spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it."
OBAMA,75.7,time 1,candidate,"And we said, Why not cut out the middleman?"
OBAMA,75.7,time 3,candidate,The next ten.
OBAMA,75.8,time 1,candidate,"And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans."
OBAMA,75.8,time 3,candidate,"And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?"
OBAMA,75.9,time 1,candidate,And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.
OBAMA,75.9,time 3,candidate,And that's the budget that we've put forward.
OBAMA,78.1,time 2,candidate,You're doing great.
OBAMA,79.1,time 1,candidate,You've done a great job.
OBAMA,81.1,time 3,candidate,"Bob, I just need to comment on this."
OBAMA,81.1,time 3,candidate,"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them."
OBAMA,81.11,time 3,candidate,"We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."
OBAMA,81.12,time 3,candidate,"And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips."
OBAMA,81.13,time 3,candidate,It's what are our capabilities.
OBAMA,81.14,time 3,candidate,"And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home."
OBAMA,81.15,time 3,candidate,And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.
OBAMA,81.2,time 3,candidate,"First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed."
OBAMA,81.3,time 3,candidate,It is something that Congress has proposed.
OBAMA,81.4,time 3,candidate,It will not happen.
OBAMA,81.5,time 3,candidate,The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.
OBAMA,81.6,time 3,candidate,It is maintaining it.
OBAMA,81.7,time 3,candidate,But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.
OBAMA,81.8,time 3,candidate,"You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in one thousand nine hundred sixteen."
OBAMA,81.9,time 3,candidate,"Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed."
OBAMA,82.1,time 2,candidate,My philosophy on taxes has been simple.
OBAMA,82.1,time 2,candidate,"But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more."
OBAMA,82.11,time 2,candidate,"So what I've said is, your first dollar two hundred fifty thousand."
OBAMA,82.12,time 2,candidate,"worth of income, no change."
OBAMA,82.13,time 2,candidate,"And that means ninety eight percent of American families, ninety seven percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase."
OBAMA,82.14,time 2,candidate,I'm ready to sign that bill right now.
OBAMA,82.15,time 2,candidate,The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the ninety eight percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top two percent.
OBAMA,82.16,time 2,candidate,"But what I've also says is for above dollar two hundred fifty thousand, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president."
OBAMA,82.17,time 2,candidate,We created twenty three million new jobs.
OBAMA,82.18,time 2,candidate,That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.
OBAMA,82.19,time 2,candidate,It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.
OBAMA,82.2,time 2,candidate,"And that is, I want to give middle class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle class some relief."
OBAMA,82.2,time 2,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy."
OBAMA,82.21,time 2,candidate,"He was on sixty Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making dollar twenty million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making dollar fifty thousand year?"
OBAMA,82.22,time 2,candidate,"And he said, Yes, I think that's fair."
OBAMA,82.23,time 2,candidate,"Not only that, he said, I think that's what grows the economy."
OBAMA,82.24,time 2,candidate,"Well, I fundamentally disagree with that."
OBAMA,82.25,time 2,candidate,I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.
OBAMA,82.26,time 2,candidate,I think that grows the economy.
OBAMA,82.27,time 2,candidate,I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.
OBAMA,82.28,time 2,candidate,That grows our economy.
OBAMA,82.29,time 2,candidate,So we just have a different theory.
OBAMA,82.3,time 2,candidate,Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.
OBAMA,82.3,time 2,candidate,"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said I'm going to give tax cuts he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said tax cuts to everybody, including the top one percent, you should believe him because that's been his history."
OBAMA,82.31,time 2,candidate,And that's exactly the kind of top down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.
OBAMA,82.4,time 2,candidate,"Over the last fifteen, over the last twenty years."
OBAMA,82.5,time 2,candidate,So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.
OBAMA,82.6,time 2,candidate,"Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle class families, and that's what I've done, by dollar three thousand six hundred|"
OBAMA,82.7,time 2,candidate,"I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth."
OBAMA,82.8,time 2,candidate,And we've cut them eighteen times.
OBAMA,82.9,time 2,candidate,"And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle class families, and for small business."
OBAMA,83.1,time 3,candidate,"And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work."
OBAMA,85.1,time 3,candidate,"First of all, Israel is a true friend."
OBAMA,85.2,time 3,candidate,It is our greatest ally in the region.
OBAMA,85.3,time 3,candidate,"And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel."
OBAMA,85.4,time 3,candidate,I've made that clear throughout my presidency.
OBAMA,85.5,time 3,candidate,And|
OBAMA,86.1,time 2,candidate,"No, it's not settled."
OBAMA,86.1,time 2,candidate,He can't tell you.
OBAMA,86.11,time 2,candidate,The the fact that he only has to pay fourteen percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.
OBAMA,86.12,time 2,candidate,"He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we we're not going to get money that way."
OBAMA,86.13,time 2,candidate,We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.
OBAMA,86.14,time 2,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor."
OBAMA,86.15,time 2,candidate,"If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend dollar seven or dollar eight trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up."
OBAMA,86.16,time 2,candidate,"And and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, dollar seven trillion dollar eight trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have."
OBAMA,86.17,time 2,candidate,"Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that that will pay for about four percent reduction in tax rates."
OBAMA,86.18,time 2,candidate,You're going to be paying for it.
OBAMA,86.19,time 2,candidate,"You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch."
OBAMA,86.2,time 2,candidate,"Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, twenty percent."
OBAMA,86.2,time 2,candidate,"Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up."
OBAMA,86.3,time 2,candidate,"Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about dollar five trillion."
OBAMA,86.4,time 2,candidate,Governor Romney then also wants to spend dollar two trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.
OBAMA,86.5,time 2,candidate,That's dollar seven trillion.
OBAMA,86.6,time 2,candidate,He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
OBAMA,86.7,time 2,candidate,That's another trillion dollars that's dollar eight trillion.
OBAMA,86.8,time 2,candidate,"Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes."
OBAMA,86.9,time 2,candidate,"But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?"
OBAMA,87.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them."
OBAMA,87.1,time 1,candidate,"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, I'll sit down, but you have to have a plan."
OBAMA,87.1,time 3,candidate,I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.
OBAMA,87.1,time 3,candidate,"And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security."
OBAMA,87.11,time 1,candidate,"Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to to to folks both in your own party and in the other party."
OBAMA,87.11,time 3,candidate,We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.
OBAMA,87.12,time 1,candidate,"And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?"
OBAMA,87.12,time 3,candidate,Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.
OBAMA,87.13,time 1,candidate,"Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had."
OBAMA,87.13,time 3,candidate,"And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non state actors, that's unacceptable."
OBAMA,87.14,time 1,candidate,"When when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have."
OBAMA,87.14,time 3,candidate,And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.
OBAMA,87.15,time 3,candidate,So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.
OBAMA,87.16,time 3,candidate,"They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table."
OBAMA,87.17,time 3,candidate,"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action."
OBAMA,87.18,time 3,candidate,"I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."
OBAMA,87.2,time 1,candidate,"But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class."
OBAMA,87.2,time 3,candidate,"And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history."
OBAMA,87.3,time 1,candidate,That's how we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses.
OBAMA,87.3,time 3,candidate,"In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week."
OBAMA,87.4,time 1,candidate,That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.
OBAMA,87.4,time 3,candidate,"But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon."
OBAMA,87.5,time 1,candidate,That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.
OBAMA,87.5,time 3,candidate,I made that clear when I came into office.
OBAMA,87.6,time 1,candidate,That's how we repealed don't ask/don't tell.
OBAMA,87.6,time 3,candidate,"We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy."
OBAMA,87.7,time 1,candidate,"That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan."
OBAMA,87.7,time 3,candidate,Their currency has dropped eighty percent.
OBAMA,87.8,time 1,candidate,That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.
OBAMA,87.8,time 3,candidate,Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq twenty years ago.
OBAMA,87.9,time 1,candidate,So we've we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.
OBAMA,87.9,time 3,candidate,So their economy is in a shambles.
OBAMA,89.1,time 1,candidate,"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things."
OBAMA,89.2,time 1,candidate,"And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party."
OBAMA,91.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it."
OBAMA,91.1,time 1,candidate,And everybody's getting a fair shot.
OBAMA,91.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper."
OBAMA,91.1,time 3,candidate,And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.
OBAMA,91.11,time 1,candidate,"And everybody's getting a fair share everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules."
OBAMA,91.11,time 3,candidate,"You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference."
OBAMA,91.12,time 1,candidate,"You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president."
OBAMA,91.12,time 3,candidate,And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.
OBAMA,91.13,time 1,candidate,And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.
OBAMA,91.13,time 3,candidate,It's meticulous.
OBAMA,91.14,time 1,candidate,"But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class."
OBAMA,91.14,time 3,candidate,We started from the day we got into office.
OBAMA,91.15,time 1,candidate,"I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term."
OBAMA,91.15,time 3,candidate,"And the reason is was so important and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China."
OBAMA,91.16,time 3,candidate,Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions we've had sanctions in place a long time.
OBAMA,91.17,time 3,candidate,It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.
OBAMA,91.18,time 3,candidate,And we've got to maintain that pressure.
OBAMA,91.19,time 3,candidate,"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established."
OBAMA,91.2,time 1,candidate,And I want to thank the University of Denver.
OBAMA,91.2,time 3,candidate,They are not true.
OBAMA,91.2,time 3,candidate,They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.
OBAMA,91.21,time 3,candidate,There are inspections that are very intrusive.
OBAMA,91.22,time 3,candidate,"But over time, what they can do is regain credibility."
OBAMA,91.23,time 3,candidate,"In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place."
OBAMA,91.24,time 3,candidate,And one last thing just just to make this point.
OBAMA,91.25,time 3,candidate,The clock is ticking.
OBAMA,91.26,time 3,candidate,We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.
OBAMA,91.27,time 3,candidate,And I've been very clear to them.
OBAMA,91.28,time 3,candidate,"You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program."
OBAMA,91.29,time 3,candidate,And that clock is ticking.
OBAMA,91.3,time 1,candidate,"You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis."
OBAMA,91.3,time 3,candidate,But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.
OBAMA,91.3,time 3,candidate,"And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon."
OBAMA,91.4,time 1,candidate,And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.
OBAMA,91.4,time 3,candidate,N.
OBAMA,91.5,time 1,candidate,"And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at fifty five to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession."
OBAMA,91.5,time 3,candidate,resolutions that have been in place.
OBAMA,91.6,time 1,candidate,"The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America."
OBAMA,91.6,time 3,candidate,"Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that."
OBAMA,91.7,time 1,candidate,And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.
OBAMA,91.7,time 3,candidate,There there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.
OBAMA,91.8,time 1,candidate,"And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future."
OBAMA,91.8,time 3,candidate,"And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program."
OBAMA,91.9,time 1,candidate,"All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is is channeled and and they have an opportunity to succeed."
OBAMA,91.9,time 3,candidate,It's very straightforward.
OBAMA,94.1,time 2,candidate,Great.
OBAMA,94.1,time 3,candidate,"Bob, let me just respond."
OBAMA,94.1,time 3,candidate,"When I came into office, the world was divided."
OBAMA,94.11,time 3,candidate,Iran was resurgent.
OBAMA,94.12,time 3,candidate,"Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since then in many years."
OBAMA,94.13,time 3,candidate,And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.
OBAMA,94.14,time 3,candidate,That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.
OBAMA,94.2,time 2,candidate,Looking forward to it.
OBAMA,94.2,time 3,candidate,"Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing."
OBAMA,94.3,time 2,candidate,"And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you."
OBAMA,94.3,time 3,candidate,This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.
OBAMA,94.4,time 3,candidate,"And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true."
OBAMA,94.5,time 3,candidate,"And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever."
OBAMA,94.6,time 3,candidate,"And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector."
OBAMA,94.7,time 3,candidate,"So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions."
OBAMA,94.8,time 3,candidate,"And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for."
OBAMA,94.9,time 3,candidate,And and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.
OBAMA,96.1,time 2,candidate,"Well, Katherine, that's a great question."
OBAMA,96.1,time 2,candidate,And this is one of the reasons why one of the first the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.
OBAMA,96.1,time 3,candidate,"Bob, let me let me respond."
OBAMA,96.1,time 3,candidate,And the the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?
OBAMA,96.11,time 2,candidate,"And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it."
OBAMA,96.11,time 3,candidate,"And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities."
OBAMA,96.12,time 2,candidate,So we fixed that.
OBAMA,96.12,time 3,candidate,And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.
OBAMA,96.13,time 2,candidate,"And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family."
OBAMA,96.13,time 3,candidate,And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.
OBAMA,96.14,time 2,candidate,"This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it."
OBAMA,96.15,time 2,candidate,It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.
OBAMA,96.16,time 2,candidate,"Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people."
OBAMA,96.17,time 2,candidate,"Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done."
OBAMA,96.18,time 2,candidate,"We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country."
OBAMA,96.19,time 2,candidate,"We did it by taking dollar sixty billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman."
OBAMA,96.2,time 2,candidate,"And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids."
OBAMA,96.2,time 2,candidate,Let's give the money directly to students.
OBAMA,96.2,time 3,candidate,"If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops."
OBAMA,96.21,time 2,candidate,"And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace."
OBAMA,96.22,time 2,candidate,"But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination."
OBAMA,96.23,time 2,candidate,That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.
OBAMA,96.24,time 2,candidate,I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.
OBAMA,96.3,time 2,candidate,And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.
OBAMA,96.3,time 3,candidate,"And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors."
OBAMA,96.4,time 2,candidate,"My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank."
OBAMA,96.4,time 3,candidate,I didn't attend fundraisers.
OBAMA,96.5,time 2,candidate,"She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip."
OBAMA,96.5,time 3,candidate,"I went to Yad Beshef, the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable."
OBAMA,96.6,time 2,candidate,"And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling."
OBAMA,96.6,time 3,candidate,"And then I went down to the border towns of Storok, which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas."
OBAMA,96.7,time 2,candidate,She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.
OBAMA,96.7,time 3,candidate,And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedroo Miss And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.
OBAMA,96.8,time 2,candidate,She didn't complain.
OBAMA,96.8,time 3,candidate,"Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles."
OBAMA,96.9,time 2,candidate,That's not what you did in that generation.
OBAMA,96.9,time 3,candidate,"So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region."
OBAMA,102.1,time 2,candidate,"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?"
OBAMA,102.1,time 2,candidate,It makes a difference.
OBAMA,102.11,time 2,candidate,This is money out of that family's pocket.
OBAMA,102.12,time 2,candidate,"Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."
OBAMA,102.13,time 2,candidate,That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.
OBAMA,102.14,time 2,candidate,"When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings."
OBAMA,102.15,time 2,candidate,That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.
OBAMA,102.16,time 2,candidate,And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.
OBAMA,102.17,time 2,candidate,"When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing."
OBAMA,102.18,time 2,candidate,That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and and earn a living for their family.
OBAMA,102.19,time 2,candidate,These are not just women's issues.
OBAMA,102.2,time 2,candidate,"He said, I'll get back to you."
OBAMA,102.2,time 2,candidate,These are family issues.
OBAMA,102.21,time 2,candidate,These are economic issues.
OBAMA,102.22,time 2,candidate,And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.
OBAMA,102.3,time 2,candidate,And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.
OBAMA,102.4,time 2,candidate,"Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace."
OBAMA,102.5,time 2,candidate,"For example, their healthcare."
OBAMA,102.6,time 2,candidate,You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.
OBAMA,102.7,time 2,candidate,I think that's a mistake.
OBAMA,102.8,time 2,candidate,"In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured."
OBAMA,102.9,time 2,candidate,"Because this is not just a a health issue, it's an economic issue for women."
OBAMA,103.1,time 3,candidate,"Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map."
OBAMA,103.1,time 3,candidate,"And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him."
OBAMA,103.11,time 3,candidate,And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.
OBAMA,103.12,time 3,candidate,"You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when nine/eleven happened."
OBAMA,103.13,time 3,candidate,"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying Peyton, I love you and I will always watch over you."
OBAMA,103.14,time 3,candidate,"And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation."
OBAMA,103.15,time 3,candidate,"And she said to me, You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me."
OBAMA,103.16,time 3,candidate,"And when we do things like that when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton that we did not forget her father."
OBAMA,103.17,time 3,candidate,"And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular."
OBAMA,103.18,time 3,candidate,Those decisions generally generally are not poll tested.
OBAMA,103.19,time 3,candidate,"And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did."
OBAMA,103.2,time 3,candidate,"I mean, I'm I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program."
OBAMA,103.2,time 3,candidate,"But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions."
OBAMA,103.3,time 3,candidate,But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.
OBAMA,103.4,time 3,candidate,"In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends."
OBAMA,103.5,time 3,candidate,"In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have twenty thousand more folks in there."
OBAMA,103.6,time 3,candidate,The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.
OBAMA,103.7,time 3,candidate,"When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call."
OBAMA,103.8,time 3,candidate,"But when you were a candidate in two thousand eight, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man."
OBAMA,103.9,time 3,candidate,And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.
OBAMA,104.1,time 2,candidate,And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.
OBAMA,104.2,time 2,candidate,That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.
OBAMA,108.1,time 2,candidate,"I don't think so, Candy."
OBAMA,110.1,time 2,candidate,I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.
OBAMA,113.1,time 3,candidate,"When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade."
OBAMA,113.1,time 3,candidate,"Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion."
OBAMA,113.11,time 3,candidate,"We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need."
OBAMA,113.12,time 3,candidate,But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.
OBAMA,113.13,time 3,candidate,"And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place."
OBAMA,113.14,time 3,candidate,"You know, I was having lunch with some a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances."
OBAMA,113.15,time 3,candidate,"When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch."
OBAMA,113.16,time 3,candidate,And what we've said is let's change those certifications.
OBAMA,113.17,time 3,candidate,The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.
OBAMA,113.18,time 3,candidate,"And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population."
OBAMA,113.19,time 3,candidate,It was higher when I came into office.
OBAMA,113.2,time 3,candidate,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops."
OBAMA,113.2,time 3,candidate,So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.
OBAMA,113.3,time 3,candidate,That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.
OBAMA,113.4,time 3,candidate,And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.
OBAMA,113.5,time 3,candidate,Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.
OBAMA,113.6,time 3,candidate,We went because there were people who were responsible for three thousand American deaths.
OBAMA,113.7,time 3,candidate,And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
OBAMA,113.8,time 3,candidate,We then started to build up Afghan forces.
OBAMA,113.9,time 3,candidate,"And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country."
OBAMA,114.1,time 2,candidate,Governor|
OBAMA,117.1,time 2,candidate,"Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times."
OBAMA,117.1,time 2,candidate,"That's Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China."
OBAMA,117.11,time 2,candidate,"And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field."
OBAMA,117.12,time 2,candidate,We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.
OBAMA,117.13,time 2,candidate,"When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers."
OBAMA,117.14,time 2,candidate,"Well, in fact we saved one thousand jobs."
OBAMA,117.15,time 2,candidate,And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.
OBAMA,117.16,time 2,candidate,But the last point I want to make is this.
OBAMA,117.17,time 2,candidate,"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush."
OBAMA,117.18,time 2,candidate,George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.
OBAMA,117.19,time 2,candidate,George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.
OBAMA,117.2,time 2,candidate,We were losing eight hundred thousand jobs a month when I started.
OBAMA,117.2,time 2,candidate,He didn't call for self deportation.
OBAMA,117.21,time 2,candidate,"George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy."
OBAMA,117.22,time 2,candidate,"In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy."
OBAMA,117.23,time 2,candidate,And I think that's a mistake.
OBAMA,117.24,time 2,candidate,That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.
OBAMA,117.3,time 2,candidate,But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.
OBAMA,117.4,time 2,candidate,"Now, we've seen thirty consecutive thirty one consecutive months of job growth; five."
OBAMA,117.5,time 2,candidate,two million new jobs created.
OBAMA,117.6,time 2,candidate,And the plans that I talked about will create even more.
OBAMA,117.7,time 2,candidate,"But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts."
OBAMA,117.8,time 2,candidate,That's what took us from surplus to deficit.
OBAMA,117.9,time 2,candidate,"When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks."
OBAMA,118.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden."
OBAMA,118.1,time 3,candidate,But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.
OBAMA,118.11,time 3,candidate,And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.
OBAMA,118.12,time 3,candidate,But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.
OBAMA,118.13,time 3,candidate,"The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office."
OBAMA,118.14,time 3,candidate,And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.
OBAMA,118.15,time 3,candidate,S.
OBAMA,118.16,time 3,candidate,homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.
OBAMA,118.2,time 3,candidate,"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan."
OBAMA,118.3,time 3,candidate,"And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works."
OBAMA,118.4,time 3,candidate,"So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries."
OBAMA,118.5,time 3,candidate,And we have stood on the side of democracy.
OBAMA,118.6,time 3,candidate,"One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation me, my administration stood with them earlier than just about any country."
OBAMA,118.7,time 3,candidate,In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.
OBAMA,118.8,time 3,candidate,In Libya we stood on the side of the people.
OBAMA,118.9,time 3,candidate,"And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed."
OBAMA,120.1,time 2,candidate,"Well, we've gone through a tough four years."
OBAMA,120.1,time 2,candidate,"We've created five million jobs, and gone from eight hundred jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress."
OBAMA,120.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks."
OBAMA,120.1,time 3,candidate,And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.
OBAMA,120.11,time 2,candidate,We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.
OBAMA,120.11,time 3,candidate,I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.
OBAMA,120.12,time 2,candidate,"Now, does that mean you're not struggling?"
OBAMA,120.12,time 3,candidate,"But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way."
OBAMA,120.13,time 2,candidate,Absolutely not.
OBAMA,120.13,time 3,candidate,They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.
OBAMA,120.14,time 2,candidate,A lot of us are.
OBAMA,120.14,time 3,candidate,"Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking taking care of business here at home."
OBAMA,120.15,time 2,candidate,"And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work."
OBAMA,120.15,time 3,candidate,"If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition."
OBAMA,120.16,time 2,candidate,"Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future."
OBAMA,120.16,time 3,candidate,"And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments."
OBAMA,120.17,time 2,candidate,"All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept."
OBAMA,120.18,time 2,candidate,"And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term."
OBAMA,120.19,time 2,candidate,"But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well."
OBAMA,120.2,time 2,candidate,There's no doubt about it.
OBAMA,120.2,time 2,candidate,And I suspect he'll keep those too.
OBAMA,120.2,time 3,candidate,"We have to remain vigilant, as I just said."
OBAMA,120.21,time 2,candidate,"You know when members of the Republican Congress say, We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college."
OBAMA,120.22,time 2,candidate,"He said, Me too."
OBAMA,120.23,time 2,candidate,"When they said, We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."
OBAMA,120.24,time 2,candidate,"He said, Me too."
OBAMA,120.25,time 2,candidate,"When he said, We're going to repeal Obamacare."
OBAMA,120.26,time 2,candidate,"First thing I'm going to do, despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well."
OBAMA,120.27,time 2,candidate,"He said, Me too."
OBAMA,120.28,time 2,candidate,"That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep."
OBAMA,120.3,time 2,candidate,"But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families."
OBAMA,120.3,time 3,candidate,"But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules."
OBAMA,120.4,time 2,candidate,And I did.
OBAMA,120.4,time 3,candidate,So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.
OBAMA,120.5,time 2,candidate,"I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have."
OBAMA,120.5,time 3,candidate,I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.
OBAMA,120.6,time 2,candidate,"I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did."
OBAMA,120.6,time 3,candidate,And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.
OBAMA,120.7,time 2,candidate,"I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on nine/eleven, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead."
OBAMA,120.7,time 3,candidate,"That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other the previous administration had done in two ter Miss And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided."
OBAMA,120.8,time 2,candidate,"I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have."
OBAMA,120.8,time 3,candidate,"In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest Pennsylvania are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case."
OBAMA,120.9,time 2,candidate,"I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the one thousand nine hundred thirtys."
OBAMA,120.9,time 3,candidate,We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires or or cheap Chinese tires.
OBAMA,122.1,time 2,candidate,the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?
OBAMA,122.2,time 2,candidate,Make sure your kids can go to college.
OBAMA,122.3,time 2,candidate,"Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security|"
OBAMA,124.1,time 2,candidate,will be there for you.
OBAMA,125.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas."
OBAMA,125.1,time 3,candidate,"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the in things like clean energy technology."
OBAMA,125.11,time 3,candidate,"Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U."
OBAMA,125.12,time 3,candidate,S.
OBAMA,125.13,time 3,candidate,"exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U."
OBAMA,125.14,time 3,candidate,S.
OBAMA,125.15,time 3,candidate,exporters since one thousand nine hundred ninety three.
OBAMA,125.16,time 3,candidate,We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.
OBAMA,125.17,time 3,candidate,"And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future."
OBAMA,125.18,time 3,candidate,"And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there."
OBAMA,125.19,time 3,candidate,"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues."
OBAMA,125.2,time 3,candidate,"And, you know, that's you're right."
OBAMA,125.2,time 3,candidate,And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.
OBAMA,125.21,time 3,candidate,That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.
OBAMA,125.22,time 3,candidate,That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.
OBAMA,125.3,time 3,candidate,I mean that's how our free market works.
OBAMA,125.4,time 3,candidate,But I've made a different bet on American workers.
OBAMA,125.5,time 3,candidate,"If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China."
OBAMA,125.6,time 3,candidate,If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.
OBAMA,125.7,time 3,candidate,S.
OBAMA,125.8,time 3,candidate,taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.
OBAMA,125.9,time 3,candidate,"Now that's estimated to create eight hundred thousand jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China."
OBAMA,127.1,time 3,candidate,"Governor Romney, that's not what you said|"
OBAMA,127.2,time 3,candidate,"Governor Romney, you did not|"
OBAMA,128.1,time 2,candidate,This is for Governor Romney?
OBAMA,129.1,time 3,candidate,You did not say that you would provide government help.
OBAMA,131.1,time 3,candidate,Let's check the record.
OBAMA,133.1,time 3,candidate,Let let let's|
OBAMA,135.1,time 3,candidate,at the record.
OBAMA,137.1,time 3,candidate,"Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget."
OBAMA,139.1,time 2,candidate,"Good, I look forward to it."
OBAMA,139.1,time 2,candidate,They'll start new businesses.
OBAMA,139.1,time 3,candidate,Governor?
OBAMA,139.11,time 2,candidate,They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.
OBAMA,139.12,time 2,candidate,"Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in forty years."
OBAMA,139.13,time 2,candidate,"What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families."
OBAMA,139.14,time 2,candidate,And that's what we've done.
OBAMA,139.15,time 2,candidate,"And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents."
OBAMA,139.16,time 2,candidate,"Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag."
OBAMA,139.17,time 2,candidate,Think of this as their country.
OBAMA,139.18,time 2,candidate,Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.
OBAMA,139.19,time 2,candidate,And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.
OBAMA,139.2,time 2,candidate,Was Lorranna Lorraine we are a nation of immigrants.
OBAMA,139.2,time 2,candidate,And that's what I've done administratively.
OBAMA,139.21,time 2,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, I will veto the DREAM Act, that would allow these young people to have access."
OBAMA,139.22,time 2,candidate,"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, We're going to encourage self deportation."
OBAMA,139.23,time 2,candidate,Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.
OBAMA,139.24,time 2,candidate,He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.
OBAMA,139.25,time 2,candidate,Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.
OBAMA,139.26,time 2,candidate,You know what?
OBAMA,139.27,time 2,candidate,"If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want I don't want to empower somebody like that."
OBAMA,139.28,time 2,candidate,"So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way."
OBAMA,139.29,time 2,candidate,"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, Well Obama didn't try."
OBAMA,139.3,time 2,candidate,I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.
OBAMA,139.3,time 2,candidate,That's not true.
OBAMA,139.31,time 2,candidate,I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.
OBAMA,139.32,time 2,candidate,"And I said, let's fix this system."
OBAMA,139.33,time 2,candidate,Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.
OBAMA,139.34,time 2,candidate,"But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting."
OBAMA,139.4,time 2,candidate,We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.
OBAMA,139.5,time 2,candidate,People are willing to take risks.
OBAMA,139.6,time 2,candidate,People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.
OBAMA,139.7,time 2,candidate,But we're also a nation of laws.
OBAMA,139.8,time 2,candidate,So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.
OBAMA,139.9,time 2,candidate,"The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth."
OBAMA,141.1,time 3,candidate,The fact of the matter is|
OBAMA,143.1,time 3,candidate,Yeah.
OBAMA,144.1,time 2,candidate,Candy?
OBAMA,144.2,time 2,candidate,Hold on a second.
OBAMA,144.3,time 2,candidate,The|
OBAMA,145.1,time 3,candidate,Governor?
OBAMA,147.1,time 3,candidate,I'm I'm I'm happy.
OBAMA,148.1,time 2,candidate,I've got to say|
OBAMA,149.1,time 3,candidate,to respond to you|
OBAMA,150.1,time 2,candidate,"You know, I I don't look at my pension."
OBAMA,150.2,time 2,candidate,It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.
OBAMA,151.1,time 3,candidate,you've had the floor for a while.
OBAMA,152.1,time 2,candidate,I don't check it that often.
OBAMA,153.1,time 3,candidate,"The look, I think anybody out there can check the record."
OBAMA,153.2,time 3,candidate,"Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here."
OBAMA,153.3,time 3,candidate,"You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U."
OBAMA,153.4,time 3,candidate,S.
OBAMA,153.5,time 3,candidate,"auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy."
OBAMA,153.6,time 3,candidate,You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.
OBAMA,153.7,time 3,candidate,That wasn't true.
OBAMA,153.8,time 3,candidate,They would have gone through a|
OBAMA,155.1,time 2,candidate,I thought we were talking about immigration.
OBAMA,155.1,time 3,candidate,they would have gone through a|
OBAMA,155.2,time 2,candidate,I do want to make sure that|
OBAMA,157.1,time 2,candidate,I do want to make sure that I do want to make sure that we just understand something.
OBAMA,157.1,time 2,candidate,"Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better."
OBAMA,157.1,time 3,candidate,"No, I am not wrong."
OBAMA,157.11,time 2,candidate,"But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't|"
OBAMA,157.2,time 2,candidate,Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.
OBAMA,157.2,time 3,candidate,I am not wrong.
OBAMA,157.3,time 2,candidate,"His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E Verify, the whole thing."
OBAMA,157.4,time 2,candidate,That's his policy.
OBAMA,157.5,time 2,candidate,And it's a bad policy.
OBAMA,157.6,time 2,candidate,And it won't help us grow.
OBAMA,157.7,time 2,candidate,"Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise."
OBAMA,157.8,time 2,candidate,And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.
OBAMA,157.9,time 2,candidate,And we want to encourage that.
OBAMA,159.1,time 2,candidate,we can't we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.
OBAMA,159.1,time 3,candidate,People will look it up.
OBAMA,159.2,time 2,candidate,And it's time for them to get serious on it.
OBAMA,161.1,time 2,candidate,This used to be a bipartisan issue.
OBAMA,161.1,time 3,candidate,"But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now."
OBAMA,161.1,time 3,candidate,What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.
OBAMA,161.11,time 3,candidate,That's why we have to move forward and not go back.
OBAMA,161.2,time 3,candidate,"Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice."
OBAMA,161.3,time 3,candidate,That will not help us compete with China.
OBAMA,161.4,time 3,candidate,"Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice."
OBAMA,161.5,time 3,candidate,That will not help us compete with China.
OBAMA,161.6,time 3,candidate,"Bringing down our deficit by adding dollar seven trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive."
OBAMA,161.7,time 3,candidate,Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.
OBAMA,161.8,time 3,candidate,"Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive."
OBAMA,161.9,time 3,candidate,"And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress."
OBAMA,163.1,time 2,candidate,OK.
OBAMA,163.2,time 2,candidate,"Hi, Kerry."
OBAMA,164.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University."
OBAMA,164.1,time 3,candidate,And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.
OBAMA,164.11,time 3,candidate,I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.
OBAMA,164.12,time 3,candidate,"Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a twenty onest century economy."
OBAMA,164.13,time 3,candidate,"As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm."
OBAMA,164.14,time 3,candidate,"but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom."
OBAMA,164.15,time 3,candidate,"And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices."
OBAMA,164.16,time 3,candidate,I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.
OBAMA,164.17,time 3,candidate,Thank you.
OBAMA,164.2,time 3,candidate,"You've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials."
OBAMA,164.3,time 3,candidate,And now you've got a choice.
OBAMA,164.4,time 3,candidate,"Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression."
OBAMA,164.5,time 3,candidate,"And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do."
OBAMA,164.6,time 3,candidate,And I've got a different vision for America.
OBAMA,164.7,time 3,candidate,I want to build on our strengths.
OBAMA,164.8,time 3,candidate,"And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas."
OBAMA,164.9,time 3,candidate,I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.
OBAMA,165.1,time 2,candidate,I'm sorry.
OBAMA,165.2,time 2,candidate,What's your name?
OBAMA,167.1,time 2,candidate,Great to see you.
OBAMA,169.1,time 2,candidate,Ah.
OBAMA,171.1,time 2,candidate,"Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation."
OBAMA,171.1,time 2,candidate,Now Governor Romney had a very different response.
OBAMA,171.11,time 2,candidate,"While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates."
OBAMA,171.12,time 2,candidate,You don't turn national security into a political issue.
OBAMA,171.13,time 2,candidate,Certainly not right when it's happening.
OBAMA,171.14,time 2,candidate,And people not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.
OBAMA,171.15,time 2,candidate,"But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say."
OBAMA,171.16,time 2,candidate,"I said I'd end the war in Libya in in Iraq, and I did."
OBAMA,171.17,time 2,candidate,"I said that we'd go after al Qaeda and bin Laden, we have."
OBAMA,171.18,time 2,candidate,"I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing."
OBAMA,171.19,time 2,candidate,"And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable."
OBAMA,171.2,time 2,candidate,"And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives."
OBAMA,171.2,time 2,candidate,"And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home."
OBAMA,171.21,time 2,candidate,You know that I mean what I say.
OBAMA,171.3,time 2,candidate,"I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way."
OBAMA,171.4,time 2,candidate,I know these folks and I know their families.
OBAMA,171.5,time 2,candidate,So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.
OBAMA,171.6,time 2,candidate,"So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions."
OBAMA,171.7,time 2,candidate,"Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region."
OBAMA,171.8,time 2,candidate,"Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again."
OBAMA,171.9,time 2,candidate,"And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them."
OBAMA,175.1,time 2,candidate,Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.
OBAMA,175.1,time 2,candidate,That's not what we do.
OBAMA,175.11,time 2,candidate,"That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief."
OBAMA,175.2,time 2,candidate,But she works for me.
OBAMA,175.3,time 2,candidate,"I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do."
OBAMA,175.4,time 2,candidate,"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened."
OBAMA,175.5,time 2,candidate,That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.
OBAMA,175.6,time 2,candidate,"And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families."
OBAMA,175.7,time 2,candidate,"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U."
OBAMA,175.8,time 2,candidate,N.
OBAMA,175.9,time 2,candidate,"Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive."
OBAMA,180.1,time 2,candidate,That's what I said.
OBAMA,182.1,time 2,candidate,Please proceed governor.
OBAMA,184.1,time 2,candidate,Get the transcript.
OBAMA,186.1,time 2,candidate,"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?"
OBAMA,191.1,time 2,candidate,Candy?
OBAMA,193.1,time 2,candidate,"Candy, I'm|"
OBAMA,196.1,time 2,candidate,I'm happy to have a longer conversation|
OBAMA,198.1,time 2,candidate,about foreign policy.
OBAMA,200.1,time 2,candidate,OK.
OBAMA,200.2,time 2,candidate,"I'm happy to do that, too."
OBAMA,202.1,time 2,candidate,I just want to make sure that|
OBAMA,204.1,time 2,candidate,all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.
OBAMA,207.1,time 2,candidate,"We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment."
OBAMA,207.1,time 2,candidate,"We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement."
OBAMA,207.11,time 2,candidate,But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.
OBAMA,207.12,time 2,candidate,And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.
OBAMA,207.13,time 2,candidate,Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.
OBAMA,207.14,time 2,candidate,But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.
OBAMA,207.15,time 2,candidate,"Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK forty sevens."
OBAMA,207.16,time 2,candidate,They're using cheap hand guns.
OBAMA,207.17,time 2,candidate,"And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control."
OBAMA,207.18,time 2,candidate,And so what I want is a is a comprehensive strategy.
OBAMA,207.19,time 2,candidate,Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.
OBAMA,207.2,time 2,candidate,We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.
OBAMA,207.2,time 2,candidate,But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.
OBAMA,207.3,time 2,candidate,"But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody."
OBAMA,207.4,time 2,candidate,Most recently out in Aurora.
OBAMA,207.5,time 2,candidate,"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater."
OBAMA,207.6,time 2,candidate,And her son had been shot through the head.
OBAMA,207.7,time 2,candidate,"And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new."
OBAMA,207.8,time 2,candidate,But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.
OBAMA,207.9,time 2,candidate,"So my belief is that,, we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill."
OBAMA,210.1,time 2,candidate,"because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they're less likely to engage in these kind of violent acts."
OBAMA,210.1,time 2,candidate,"As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before."
OBAMA,210.11,time 2,candidate,Now|
OBAMA,210.2,time 2,candidate,"We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed, and we've got to make sure they don't get weapons."
OBAMA,210.3,time 2,candidate,"But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed."
OBAMA,210.4,time 2,candidate,"And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with forty six governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed."
OBAMA,210.5,time 2,candidate,We're starting to see gains in math and science.
OBAMA,210.6,time 2,candidate,"When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now."
OBAMA,210.7,time 2,candidate,"And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers."
OBAMA,210.8,time 2,candidate,And so we're matching them up.
OBAMA,210.9,time 2,candidate,Giving them access to higher education.
OBAMA,212.1,time 2,candidate,But but it'll it'll it'll be|
OBAMA,212.2,time 2,candidate,just one second.
OBAMA,214.1,time 2,candidate,Because because this is important.
OBAMA,214.2,time 2,candidate,This is part of the choice in this election.
OBAMA,214.3,time 2,candidate,"When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy."
OBAMA,214.4,time 2,candidate,When when he was asked would class size|
OBAMA,216.1,time 2,candidate,I understand.
OBAMA,218.1,time 2,candidate,But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people|
OBAMA,220.1,time 2,candidate,and reduce our violence.
OBAMA,225.1,time 2,candidate,OK.
OBAMA,225.1,time 2,candidate,S.
OBAMA,225.11,time 2,candidate,taxes.
OBAMA,225.12,time 2,candidate,"But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom and pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about."
OBAMA,225.13,time 2,candidate,And it's estimated that that will create eight hundred thousand new jobs.
OBAMA,225.14,time 2,candidate,The problem is they'll be in china.
OBAMA,225.15,time 2,candidate,Or India.
OBAMA,225.16,time 2,candidate,Or Germany.
OBAMA,225.17,time 2,candidate,That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.
OBAMA,225.18,time 2,candidate,"The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports."
OBAMA,225.19,time 2,candidate,"And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president."
OBAMA,225.2,time 2,candidate,We need to create jobs here.
OBAMA,225.2,time 2,candidate,That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.
OBAMA,225.21,time 2,candidate,"That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal."
OBAMA,225.22,time 2,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated."
OBAMA,225.23,time 2,candidate,"In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing."
OBAMA,225.24,time 2,candidate,That's not my phrase.
OBAMA,225.25,time 2,candidate,That's what reporters called it.
OBAMA,225.26,time 2,candidate,"And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up eleven percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard."
OBAMA,225.27,time 2,candidate,And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.
OBAMA,225.28,time 2,candidate,That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.
OBAMA,225.29,time 2,candidate,That's going to help to create jobs here.
OBAMA,225.3,time 2,candidate,And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.
OBAMA,225.4,time 2,candidate,It's too high.
OBAMA,225.5,time 2,candidate,But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.
OBAMA,225.6,time 2,candidate,"I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore."
OBAMA,225.7,time 2,candidate,All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.
OBAMA,225.8,time 2,candidate,"Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks."
OBAMA,225.9,time 2,candidate,"One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U."
OBAMA,229.1,time 2,candidate,"Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back."
OBAMA,229.1,time 2,candidate,"Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but ten years from now, fifty years from now, one hundred years from now."
OBAMA,229.2,time 2,candidate,"Because they are low wage, low skill jobs."
OBAMA,229.3,time 2,candidate,"I want high wage, high skill jobs."
OBAMA,229.4,time 2,candidate,That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.
OBAMA,229.5,time 2,candidate,That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.
OBAMA,229.6,time 2,candidate,That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.
OBAMA,229.7,time 2,candidate,"And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race."
OBAMA,229.8,time 2,candidate,If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.
OBAMA,229.9,time 2,candidate,Then companies won't come here.
OBAMA,239.1,time 2,candidate,"Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer."
OBAMA,239.1,time 2,candidate,"Loves his family, cares about his faith."
OBAMA,239.11,time 2,candidate,"But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that forty seven percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about."
OBAMA,239.12,time 2,candidate,Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.
OBAMA,239.13,time 2,candidate,Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.
OBAMA,239.14,time 2,candidate,"Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's drea Miss Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now."
OBAMA,239.15,time 2,candidate,"People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income."
OBAMA,239.16,time 2,candidate,And I want to fight for them.
OBAMA,239.17,time 2,candidate,That's what I've been doing for the last four years.
OBAMA,239.18,time 2,candidate,"Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds."
OBAMA,239.19,time 2,candidate,When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.
OBAMA,239.2,time 2,candidate,That's not what I believe.
OBAMA,239.2,time 2,candidate,I.
OBAMA,239.21,time 2,candidate,"Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout."
OBAMA,239.22,time 2,candidate,That was something that advanced the entire country.
OBAMA,239.23,time 2,candidate,And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.
OBAMA,239.24,time 2,candidate,That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.
OBAMA,239.3,time 2,candidate,I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.
OBAMA,239.4,time 2,candidate,I believe in self reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.
OBAMA,239.5,time 2,candidate,"But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that's how our economy's grown."
OBAMA,239.6,time 2,candidate,That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.
OBAMA,239.7,time 2,candidate,And and that is part of what's at stake in this election.
OBAMA,239.8,time 2,candidate,There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.
OBAMA,239.9,time 2,candidate,I believe Governor Romney is a good man.
ROMNEY,2.1,time 1,candidate,What I support is no change for current retirees and near retirees to Medicare.
ROMNEY,2.1,time 3,candidate,"Thank you, Bob."
ROMNEY,2.1,time 3,candidate,"Of course we see in Syria, thirty thousand civilians having been killed by the military there."
ROMNEY,2.11,time 3,candidate,"We see in in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against against our people there, four people dead."
ROMNEY,2.12,time 3,candidate,Our hearts and and minds go out to them.
ROMNEY,2.13,time 3,candidate,"Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al Qaeda type individuals."
ROMNEY,2.14,time 3,candidate,"We have in in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president."
ROMNEY,2.15,time 3,candidate,And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.
ROMNEY,2.16,time 3,candidate,"Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon."
ROMNEY,2.17,time 3,candidate,And and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.
ROMNEY,2.18,time 3,candidate,I congratulate him on on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al Qaeda.
ROMNEY,2.19,time 3,candidate,But we can't kill our way out of this mess.
ROMNEY,2.2,time 1,candidate,And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred sixteen billion out of that program.
ROMNEY,2.2,time 3,candidate,And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.
ROMNEY,2.2,time 3,candidate,"We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is it's certainly not on the run."
ROMNEY,2.21,time 3,candidate,It's certainly not hiding.
ROMNEY,2.22,time 3,candidate,"This is a group that is now involved in ten or twelve countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism."
ROMNEY,2.3,time 3,candidate,Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.
ROMNEY,2.4,time 3,candidate,"And Mister President, it's good to be with you again."
ROMNEY,2.5,time 3,candidate,"We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose."
ROMNEY,2.6,time 3,candidate,We'll see what happens.
ROMNEY,2.7,time 3,candidate,"This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a a complete change in the the structure and the the environment in the Middle East."
ROMNEY,2.8,time 3,candidate,"With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East."
ROMNEY,2.9,time 3,candidate,"But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events."
ROMNEY,3.1,time 2,candidate,"Thank you, Jeremy."
ROMNEY,3.1,time 2,candidate,I can't begin to pay back my student loans.
ROMNEY,3.11,time 2,candidate,So what we have to do is two things.
ROMNEY,3.12,time 2,candidate,We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.
ROMNEY,3.13,time 2,candidate,"And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job."
ROMNEY,3.14,time 2,candidate,"When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam."
ROMNEY,3.15,time 2,candidate,"If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution."
ROMNEY,3.16,time 2,candidate,I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.
ROMNEY,3.17,time 2,candidate,"We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school."
ROMNEY,3.18,time 2,candidate,But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.
ROMNEY,3.19,time 2,candidate,"And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people."
ROMNEY,3.2,time 2,candidate,"I appreciate your your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time."
ROMNEY,3.2,time 2,candidate,I want you to be able to get a job.
ROMNEY,3.21,time 2,candidate,I know what it takes to get this economy going.
ROMNEY,3.22,time 2,candidate,"With half of college kids graduating this year without a college excuse me, without a job."
ROMNEY,3.23,time 2,candidate,"And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable."
ROMNEY,3.24,time 2,candidate,And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.
ROMNEY,3.25,time 2,candidate,So more debt and less jobs.
ROMNEY,3.26,time 2,candidate,I'm going to change that.
ROMNEY,3.27,time 2,candidate,I know what it takes to create good jobs again.
ROMNEY,3.28,time 2,candidate,I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.
ROMNEY,3.29,time 2,candidate,"And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy."
ROMNEY,3.3,time 2,candidate,Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this this event.
ROMNEY,3.3,time 2,candidate,It's not going to be like the last four years.
ROMNEY,3.31,time 2,candidate,"The middle class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce."
ROMNEY,3.32,time 2,candidate,"I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate when do you graduate?"
ROMNEY,3.4,time 2,candidate,"Thank you, Mister President, also for being part of this this debate."
ROMNEY,3.5,time 2,candidate,Your question your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.
ROMNEY,3.6,time 2,candidate,"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated this was in Philadelphia and she said, I've got my degree."
ROMNEY,3.7,time 2,candidate,I can't find a job.
ROMNEY,3.8,time 2,candidate,I've got three part time jobs.
ROMNEY,3.9,time 2,candidate,They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.
ROMNEY,4.1,time 1,candidate,So that's that's number one.
ROMNEY,4.1,time 1,candidate,I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.
ROMNEY,4.11,time 1,candidate,I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.
ROMNEY,4.12,time 1,candidate,"If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company."
ROMNEY,4.13,time 1,candidate,But people make their own choice.
ROMNEY,4.14,time 1,candidate,The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?
ROMNEY,4.15,time 1,candidate,"We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits."
ROMNEY,4.16,time 1,candidate,We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.
ROMNEY,4.17,time 1,candidate,That's the plan that I've put forward.
ROMNEY,4.18,time 1,candidate,"And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or or Senator Wyden, who's the co author of the bill with with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill Bill Clinton's chief of staff."
ROMNEY,4.19,time 1,candidate,"This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality."
ROMNEY,4.2,time 1,candidate,"Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan."
ROMNEY,4.2,time 1,candidate,I believe in competition.
ROMNEY,4.3,time 1,candidate,Their choice.
ROMNEY,4.4,time 1,candidate,They get to choose and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.
ROMNEY,4.5,time 1,candidate,"So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional dollar six thousand."
ROMNEY,4.6,time 1,candidate,That's not going to happen.
ROMNEY,4.7,time 1,candidate,They'll have at least two plans.
ROMNEY,4.8,time 1,candidate,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan."
ROMNEY,4.9,time 1,candidate,I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.
ROMNEY,5.1,time 2,candidate,two thousand fourteen.
ROMNEY,5.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to to kill them, to take them out of the picture."
ROMNEY,5.1,time 3,candidate,N.
ROMNEY,5.11,time 3,candidate,", to look at how we can help the the world reject these these terrorists."
ROMNEY,5.12,time 3,candidate,"And the answer they came up with was this: One, more economic development."
ROMNEY,5.13,time 3,candidate,"We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we we push back and give them more economic development."
ROMNEY,5.14,time 3,candidate,"Number two, better education."
ROMNEY,5.15,time 3,candidate,"Number three, gender equality."
ROMNEY,5.16,time 3,candidate,"Number four, the rule of law."
ROMNEY,5.17,time 3,candidate,We have to help these nations create civil societies.
ROMNEY,5.18,time 3,candidate,"But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in."
ROMNEY,5.19,time 3,candidate,And and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.
ROMNEY,5.2,time 2,candidate,"When you come out in two thousand fourteen, I presume I'm going to be president."
ROMNEY,5.2,time 3,candidate,But my strategy is broader than that.
ROMNEY,5.2,time 3,candidate,"It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy."
ROMNEY,5.21,time 3,candidate,"But next door, of course, we have Egypt."
ROMNEY,5.22,time 3,candidate,"Libya's six million population; Egypt, eighty million population."
ROMNEY,5.23,time 3,candidate,We want we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.
ROMNEY,5.24,time 3,candidate,"With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult."
ROMNEY,5.25,time 3,candidate,"And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real."
ROMNEY,5.3,time 2,candidate,I'm going to make sure you get a job.
ROMNEY,5.3,time 3,candidate,"That's that's important, of course."
ROMNEY,5.4,time 2,candidate,Thanks Jeremy.
ROMNEY,5.4,time 3,candidate,But the key that we're going to have to pursue is a is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.
ROMNEY,5.5,time 2,candidate,"Yeah, you bet."
ROMNEY,5.5,time 3,candidate,"We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan."
ROMNEY,5.6,time 3,candidate,That's not the right course for us.
ROMNEY,5.7,time 3,candidate,"The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the the people who are leaders of these various anti American groups and these these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world."
ROMNEY,5.8,time 3,candidate,And how do we do that?
ROMNEY,5.9,time 3,candidate,"A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U."
ROMNEY,9.1,time 2,candidate,Well what you're seeing in this country is twenty three million people struggling to find a job.
ROMNEY,9.1,time 2,candidate,We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.
ROMNEY,9.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said."
ROMNEY,9.1,time 3,candidate,"It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face."
ROMNEY,9.11,time 2,candidate,That's why I put out a five point plan that gets America twelve million new jobs in four years and rising take home pay.
ROMNEY,9.11,time 3,candidate,Russia does continue to battle us in the U.
ROMNEY,9.12,time 2,candidate,It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.
ROMNEY,9.12,time 3,candidate,N.
ROMNEY,9.13,time 2,candidate,It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.
ROMNEY,9.13,time 3,candidate,time and time again.
ROMNEY,9.14,time 2,candidate,"And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt."
ROMNEY,9.14,time 3,candidate,I have clear eyes on this.
ROMNEY,9.15,time 2,candidate,And that's right.
ROMNEY,9.15,time 3,candidate,"I'm not going to wear rose colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mister Putin."
ROMNEY,9.16,time 2,candidate,My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like seven Eleven did and Macy's and Condell Airlines and come out stronger.
ROMNEY,9.16,time 3,candidate,"And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election."
ROMNEY,9.17,time 2,candidate,"And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt."
ROMNEY,9.17,time 3,candidate,"After the election, he'll get more backbone."
ROMNEY,9.18,time 2,candidate,"Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt."
ROMNEY,9.18,time 3,candidate,"Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement."
ROMNEY,9.19,time 2,candidate,You took General Motors bankrupt.
ROMNEY,9.19,time 3,candidate,Oh you didn't?
ROMNEY,9.2,time 2,candidate,"And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time."
ROMNEY,9.2,time 2,candidate,You took Chrysler bankrupt.
ROMNEY,9.2,time 3,candidate,They don't happen to be accurate.
ROMNEY,9.2,time 3,candidate,You didn't want a status of|
ROMNEY,9.21,time 2,candidate,"So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did."
ROMNEY,9.22,time 2,candidate,"And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people."
ROMNEY,9.23,time 2,candidate,That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.
ROMNEY,9.3,time 2,candidate,The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.
ROMNEY,9.3,time 3,candidate,"But but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and and confusion."
ROMNEY,9.4,time 2,candidate,We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.
ROMNEY,9.4,time 3,candidate,And and attacking me is not an agenda.
ROMNEY,9.5,time 2,candidate,If the the unemployment rate was seven.
ROMNEY,9.5,time 3,candidate,"Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence."
ROMNEY,9.6,time 2,candidate,"eight percent when he took office, it's seven."
ROMNEY,9.6,time 3,candidate,But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.
ROMNEY,9.7,time 2,candidate,eight percent now.
ROMNEY,9.7,time 3,candidate,"First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe."
ROMNEY,9.8,time 2,candidate,"But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be ten."
ROMNEY,9.8,time 3,candidate,Not|
ROMNEY,9.9,time 2,candidate,seven percent.
ROMNEY,9.9,time 3,candidate,Excuse me.
ROMNEY,10.1,time 1,candidate,That's that's a big topic.
ROMNEY,10.2,time 1,candidate,Can we can we stay on Medicare?
ROMNEY,11.1,time 3,candidate,"I'm sorry, you actually there was a there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on."
ROMNEY,11.2,time 3,candidate,That was something I concurred with|
ROMNEY,13.1,time 2,candidate,That that Detroit that Detroit answer|
ROMNEY,13.1,time 3,candidate,that your posture.
ROMNEY,13.2,time 3,candidate,That was my posture as well.
ROMNEY,13.3,time 3,candidate,You thought it should have been five thousand troops|
ROMNEY,15.1,time 1,candidate,Let's get back to Medicare.
ROMNEY,15.1,time 2,candidate,that Detroit answer|
ROMNEY,15.1,time 3,candidate,"I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?"
ROMNEY,15.2,time 3,candidate,The answer was we got|
ROMNEY,15.3,time 3,candidate,no troops through whatsoever.
ROMNEY,17.1,time 1,candidate,Let's get back to Medicare.
ROMNEY,17.1,time 2,candidate,"and the rest of the answer, way off the mark."
ROMNEY,17.1,time 3,candidate,"No, I|"
ROMNEY,17.2,time 1,candidate,The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.
ROMNEY,17.2,time 3,candidate,I'm sorry that's a|
ROMNEY,19.1,time 1,candidate,"If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase."
ROMNEY,19.1,time 3,candidate,that's a I indicated|
ROMNEY,21.1,time 1,candidate,But my experience my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.
ROMNEY,21.1,time 3,candidate,I indicated that you failed to put in place a status|
ROMNEY,22.1,time 2,candidate,"Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out."
ROMNEY,22.1,time 2,candidate,And what was the cost?
ROMNEY,22.11,time 2,candidate,twenty or twenty five birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.
ROMNEY,22.12,time 2,candidate,"Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables."
ROMNEY,22.13,time 2,candidate,"I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix."
ROMNEY,22.14,time 2,candidate,"But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas."
ROMNEY,22.15,time 2,candidate,"This has not been Mister Oil, or Mister Gas, or Mister Coal."
ROMNEY,22.16,time 2,candidate,Talk to the people that are working in those industries.
ROMNEY,22.17,time 2,candidate,I was in coal country.
ROMNEY,22.18,time 2,candidate,"People grabbed my arms and said, Please save my job."
ROMNEY,22.19,time 2,candidate,"The head of the EPA said, You can't build a coal plant."
ROMNEY,22.2,time 2,candidate,"And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land."
ROMNEY,22.2,time 2,candidate,You'll virtually it's virtually impossible given our regulations.
ROMNEY,22.21,time 2,candidate,"When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt."
ROMNEY,22.22,time 2,candidate,That's not the right course for America.
ROMNEY,22.23,time 2,candidate,"Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy ources for the future."
ROMNEY,22.24,time 2,candidate,"And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back."
ROMNEY,22.25,time 2,candidate,"Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy."
ROMNEY,22.26,time 2,candidate,I'll get America and North America energy independent.
ROMNEY,22.27,time 2,candidate,"I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses."
ROMNEY,22.28,time 2,candidate,We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.
ROMNEY,22.29,time 2,candidate,How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?
ROMNEY,22.3,time 2,candidate,"As a matter of fact, oil production is down fourteen percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down nine percent."
ROMNEY,22.3,time 2,candidate,I will never know.
ROMNEY,22.31,time 2,candidate,"This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do."
ROMNEY,22.4,time 2,candidate,Why?
ROMNEY,22.5,time 2,candidate,"Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters."
ROMNEY,22.6,time 2,candidate,So where'd the increase come from?
ROMNEY,22.7,time 2,candidate,Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.
ROMNEY,22.8,time 2,candidate,What was his participation there?
ROMNEY,22.9,time 2,candidate,"The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have."
ROMNEY,23.1,time 1,candidate,Absolutely.
ROMNEY,23.1,time 3,candidate,of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.
ROMNEY,25.1,time 1,candidate,Absolutely.
ROMNEY,25.1,time 2,candidate,But that's not what you've done in the last four years.
ROMNEY,25.2,time 2,candidate,That's the problem.
ROMNEY,25.3,time 2,candidate,"In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half."
ROMNEY,27.1,time 2,candidate,So how much did you cut?
ROMNEY,28.1,time 1,candidate,Regulation is essential.
ROMNEY,28.2,time 1,candidate,You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.
ROMNEY,28.3,time 1,candidate,"As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the regulations."
ROMNEY,28.4,time 1,candidate,I needed them there.
ROMNEY,28.5,time 1,candidate,You couldn't have people opening up banks in their in their garage and making loans.
ROMNEY,28.6,time 1,candidate,"I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work."
ROMNEY,28.7,time 1,candidate,Every free economy has good regulation.
ROMNEY,28.8,time 1,candidate,"At the same time, regulation can become excessive."
ROMNEY,29.1,time 2,candidate,"How much did you cut them by, then?"
ROMNEY,30.1,time 1,candidate,"In some places, yes."
ROMNEY,30.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is."
ROMNEY,30.1,time 3,candidate,We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.
ROMNEY,30.11,time 3,candidate,"And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a in a form of if not government, a form of of of council that can take the lead in Syria."
ROMNEY,30.12,time 3,candidate,And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.
ROMNEY,30.13,time 3,candidate,We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the the wrong hands.
ROMNEY,30.14,time 3,candidate,Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.
ROMNEY,30.15,time 3,candidate,"We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with with Israel."
ROMNEY,30.16,time 3,candidate,"But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and and the Turks are all very concerned about this."
ROMNEY,30.17,time 3,candidate,They're willing to work with us.
ROMNEY,30.18,time 3,candidate,"We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties."
ROMNEY,30.19,time 3,candidate,Recognize I believe that Assad must go.
ROMNEY,30.2,time 1,candidate,"Other places, no."
ROMNEY,30.2,time 3,candidate,"First of all, thirty thousand people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster."
ROMNEY,30.2,time 3,candidate,I believe he will go.
ROMNEY,30.21,time 3,candidate,"But I believe we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East."
ROMNEY,30.22,time 3,candidate,This this is a critical opportunity for America.
ROMNEY,30.23,time 3,candidate,"And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U."
ROMNEY,30.24,time 3,candidate,N.
ROMNEY,30.25,time 3,candidate,deal with it.
ROMNEY,30.26,time 3,candidate,"And Assad excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire."
ROMNEY,30.27,time 3,candidate,That didn't work.
ROMNEY,30.28,time 3,candidate,"Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something."
ROMNEY,30.29,time 3,candidate,"We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."
ROMNEY,30.3,time 3,candidate,"Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now."
ROMNEY,30.4,time 3,candidate,Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.
ROMNEY,30.5,time 3,candidate,It's their route to the sea.
ROMNEY,30.6,time 3,candidate,"It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel."
ROMNEY,30.7,time 3,candidate,And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.
ROMNEY,30.8,time 3,candidate,"Number two, seeing a a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us."
ROMNEY,30.9,time 3,candidate,"And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there."
ROMNEY,31.1,time 2,candidate,"No, no."
ROMNEY,31.2,time 2,candidate,How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?
ROMNEY,32.1,time 1,candidate,"No, it can become out of date."
ROMNEY,32.1,time 1,candidate,So there's one example.
ROMNEY,32.1,time 3,candidate,by the leadership role.
ROMNEY,32.11,time 1,candidate,Here's another.
ROMNEY,32.12,time 1,candidate,In Dodd Frank|
ROMNEY,32.2,time 1,candidate,"And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt it's hurt the economy."
ROMNEY,32.3,time 1,candidate,Let me give you an example.
ROMNEY,32.4,time 1,candidate,Dodd Frank was passed.
ROMNEY,32.5,time 1,candidate,And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.
ROMNEY,32.6,time 1,candidate,"One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government."
ROMNEY,32.7,time 1,candidate,This is the biggest kiss that's been given to to New York banks I've ever seen.
ROMNEY,32.8,time 1,candidate,This is an enormous boon for them.
ROMNEY,32.9,time 1,candidate,There've been one hundred twenty two community and small banks have closed since Dodd Frank.
ROMNEY,33.1,time 2,candidate,"No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?"
ROMNEY,34.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, I would repeal and replace it."
ROMNEY,34.2,time 1,candidate,We're not going to get rid of all regulation.
ROMNEY,34.3,time 1,candidate,You have to have regulation.
ROMNEY,34.4,time 1,candidate,And there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all the sense in the world.
ROMNEY,34.5,time 1,candidate,"You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for|"
ROMNEY,35.1,time 2,candidate,How much did you cut them by?
ROMNEY,35.1,time 3,candidate,I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.
ROMNEY,35.2,time 3,candidate,I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.
ROMNEY,35.3,time 3,candidate,I don't anticipate that in the future.
ROMNEY,35.4,time 3,candidate,"As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible."
ROMNEY,35.5,time 3,candidate,"And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove to remove Assad."
ROMNEY,35.6,time 3,candidate,But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our of our troops.
ROMNEY,36.1,time 1,candidate,But let's let's mention let me mention the other one.
ROMNEY,36.2,time 1,candidate,Let's talk|
ROMNEY,37.1,time 2,candidate,All right.
ROMNEY,37.1,time 3,candidate,And this isn't this isn't going to be necessary.
ROMNEY,37.1,time 3,candidate,America can help that happen.
ROMNEY,37.11,time 3,candidate,And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.
ROMNEY,37.2,time 2,candidate,And it is.
ROMNEY,37.2,time 3,candidate,"We we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups."
ROMNEY,37.3,time 3,candidate,"But look, this has been going on for a year."
ROMNEY,37.4,time 3,candidate,This is a time this should have been a time for American leadership.
ROMNEY,37.5,time 3,candidate,"We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties."
ROMNEY,37.6,time 3,candidate,"As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the the insurgents are highly disparate."
ROMNEY,37.7,time 3,candidate,They haven't come together.
ROMNEY,37.8,time 3,candidate,"They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind."
ROMNEY,37.9,time 3,candidate,That needs to happen.
ROMNEY,39.1,time 1,candidate,"Sorry, but that's just not that's just not the facts."
ROMNEY,39.1,time 1,candidate,You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.
ROMNEY,39.1,time 2,candidate,"OK,|"
ROMNEY,39.11,time 1,candidate,That's exactly right.
ROMNEY,39.12,time 1,candidate,It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.
ROMNEY,39.13,time 1,candidate,"And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was."
ROMNEY,39.14,time 1,candidate,It's been two years.
ROMNEY,39.15,time 1,candidate,We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.
ROMNEY,39.16,time 1,candidate,"So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages."
ROMNEY,39.17,time 1,candidate,Try and get a mortgage these days.
ROMNEY,39.18,time 1,candidate,It's hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.
ROMNEY,39.19,time 1,candidate,It's not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.
ROMNEY,39.2,time 1,candidate,"Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street."
ROMNEY,39.2,time 1,candidate,Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.
ROMNEY,39.21,time 1,candidate,"I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs."
ROMNEY,39.3,time 1,candidate,That's why I'd have regulation.
ROMNEY,39.4,time 1,candidate,But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.
ROMNEY,39.5,time 1,candidate,That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank.
ROMNEY,39.6,time 1,candidate,It wasn't thought through properly.
ROMNEY,39.7,time 1,candidate,We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.
ROMNEY,39.8,time 1,candidate,They're getting hurt.
ROMNEY,39.9,time 1,candidate,Let me mention another regulation in Dodd Frank.
ROMNEY,41.1,time 1,candidate,I sure do.
ROMNEY,41.1,time 1,candidate,"And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by dollar two thousand five hundred a family."
ROMNEY,41.1,time 2,candidate,And production on private on government land.
ROMNEY,41.11,time 1,candidate,"Instead, it's gone up by that amount."
ROMNEY,41.12,time 1,candidate,So it's expensive.
ROMNEY,41.13,time 1,candidate,Expensive things hurt families.
ROMNEY,41.14,time 1,candidate,So that's one reason I don't want it.
ROMNEY,41.15,time 1,candidate,"Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen billion from Medicare to pay for it."
ROMNEY,41.16,time 1,candidate,I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.
ROMNEY,41.17,time 1,candidate,"Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have."
ROMNEY,41.18,time 1,candidate,I don't like that idea.
ROMNEY,41.19,time 1,candidate,"Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?"
ROMNEY,41.2,time 1,candidate,"Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience."
ROMNEY,41.2,time 1,candidate,And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.
ROMNEY,41.21,time 1,candidate,"I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing twenty three million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people."
ROMNEY,41.22,time 1,candidate,It has killed jobs.
ROMNEY,41.23,time 1,candidate,And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.
ROMNEY,41.24,time 1,candidate,"And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the dollar two thousand five hundred additional premium."
ROMNEY,41.3,time 1,candidate,"You know, I was in New Hampshire."
ROMNEY,41.4,time 1,candidate,"A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son."
ROMNEY,41.5,time 1,candidate,"I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it."
ROMNEY,41.6,time 1,candidate,"And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive."
ROMNEY,41.7,time 1,candidate,And and we've got to deal with cost.
ROMNEY,41.8,time 1,candidate,"And, unfortunately, when when when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more than traditional insurance."
ROMNEY,41.9,time 1,candidate,So it's adding to cost.
ROMNEY,43.1,time 2,candidate,is down.
ROMNEY,45.1,time 2,candidate,Production on government land of oil is down fourteen percent.
ROMNEY,45.1,time 3,candidate,No.
ROMNEY,45.1,time 3,candidate,And the mantle of leadership for the promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.
ROMNEY,45.11,time 3,candidate,We didn't ask for it.
ROMNEY,45.12,time 3,candidate,But it's an honor that we have it.
ROMNEY,45.13,time 3,candidate,But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.
ROMNEY,45.14,time 3,candidate,And that begins with a strong economy here at home.
ROMNEY,45.15,time 3,candidate,"Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger."
ROMNEY,45.16,time 3,candidate,"When the when the president of Iraq excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing."
ROMNEY,45.17,time 3,candidate,Former chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.
ROMNEY,45.18,time 3,candidate,This we have weakened our economy.
ROMNEY,45.19,time 3,candidate,We need a strong economy.
ROMNEY,45.2,time 3,candidate,"I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his his action there."
ROMNEY,45.2,time 3,candidate,We need to have as well a strong military.
ROMNEY,45.21,time 3,candidate,Our military is second to none in the world.
ROMNEY,45.22,time 3,candidate,"We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence."
ROMNEY,45.23,time 3,candidate,But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.
ROMNEY,45.24,time 3,candidate,We need to have strong allies.
ROMNEY,45.25,time 3,candidate,Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.
ROMNEY,45.26,time 3,candidate,"We're the great nation that has allies, forty two allies and friends around the world."
ROMNEY,45.27,time 3,candidate,"And, finally, we have to stand by our principles."
ROMNEY,45.28,time 3,candidate,"And if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow."
ROMNEY,45.29,time 3,candidate,"But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence will grow."
ROMNEY,45.3,time 3,candidate,I felt that I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.
ROMNEY,45.3,time 3,candidate,"But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago."
ROMNEY,45.4,time 3,candidate,"I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did."
ROMNEY,45.5,time 3,candidate,"But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support."
ROMNEY,45.6,time 3,candidate,"Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more is peaceful."
ROMNEY,45.7,time 3,candidate,We want a peaceful planet.
ROMNEY,45.8,time 3,candidate,"We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war."
ROMNEY,45.9,time 3,candidate,That's our purpose.
ROMNEY,47.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, I did with my first statement."
ROMNEY,47.1,time 1,candidate,You've raised them by dollar one trillion under Obamacare.
ROMNEY,47.1,time 2,candidate,And production on gas.
ROMNEY,47.1,time 3,candidate,And that's because we've become weaker in each of those four|
ROMNEY,47.11,time 1,candidate,We didn't cut Medicare.
ROMNEY,47.12,time 1,candidate,"Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by dollar seven hundred sixteen billion."
ROMNEY,47.13,time 1,candidate,We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.
ROMNEY,47.14,time 1,candidate,"We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted."
ROMNEY,47.15,time 1,candidate,"Right now, the CBO says up to twenty million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year."
ROMNEY,47.16,time 1,candidate,"And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said thirty percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage."
ROMNEY,47.17,time 1,candidate,"So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare don't want Obamacare."
ROMNEY,47.18,time 1,candidate,"It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had had the plan."
ROMNEY,47.19,time 1,candidate,They put a plan out.
ROMNEY,47.2,time 1,candidate,"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts."
ROMNEY,47.2,time 1,candidate,"They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan."
ROMNEY,47.21,time 1,candidate,It was swept aside.
ROMNEY,47.22,time 1,candidate,"I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis."
ROMNEY,47.23,time 1,candidate,And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.
ROMNEY,47.3,time 1,candidate,"I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together."
ROMNEY,47.4,time 1,candidate,What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.
ROMNEY,47.5,time 1,candidate,"As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway."
ROMNEY,47.6,time 1,candidate,"So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through."
ROMNEY,47.7,time 1,candidate,"What we did in a legislature eighty seven percent Democrat, we worked together; two hundred legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished."
ROMNEY,47.8,time 1,candidate,What were some differences?
ROMNEY,47.9,time 1,candidate,We didn't raise taxes.
ROMNEY,49.1,time 2,candidate,It's absolutely true.
ROMNEY,49.1,time 3,candidate,"Well I I absolutely believe that America has a a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that that make the world more peaceful."
ROMNEY,49.1,time 3,candidate,"And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home."
ROMNEY,49.11,time 3,candidate,You can't have twenty three million people struggling to get a job.
ROMNEY,49.12,time 3,candidate,You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.
ROMNEY,49.13,time 3,candidate,"You can't have kids coming out of college, half of them can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree."
ROMNEY,49.14,time 3,candidate,We have to get our economy going.
ROMNEY,49.15,time 3,candidate,"And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long term."
ROMNEY,49.16,time 3,candidate,We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.
ROMNEY,49.17,time 3,candidate,We we make decisions today in the military that that will confront challenges we can't imagine.
ROMNEY,49.18,time 3,candidate,"In the two thousand debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance."
ROMNEY,49.19,time 3,candidate,"And a year later, nine/eleven happened."
ROMNEY,49.2,time 2,candidate,"Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more on federal lands and in federal waters."
ROMNEY,49.2,time 3,candidate,"And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections."
ROMNEY,49.2,time 3,candidate,"So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military."
ROMNEY,49.21,time 3,candidate,I will not cut our military budget.
ROMNEY,49.22,time 3,candidate,We have to also stand by our allies.
ROMNEY,49.23,time 3,candidate,I I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.
ROMNEY,49.24,time 3,candidate,"I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us."
ROMNEY,49.25,time 3,candidate,"And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake."
ROMNEY,49.26,time 3,candidate,"We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."
ROMNEY,49.3,time 2,candidate,"And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up."
ROMNEY,49.3,time 3,candidate,"Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace."
ROMNEY,49.4,time 2,candidate,"I was just at a coal facility, where some one thousand two hundred people lost their jobs."
ROMNEY,49.4,time 3,candidate,They don't vote for war.
ROMNEY,49.5,time 2,candidate,The right course for America is to have a true all of the above policy.
ROMNEY,49.5,time 3,candidate,So we want to promote those principles around the world.
ROMNEY,49.6,time 2,candidate,I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.
ROMNEY,49.6,time 3,candidate,We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.
ROMNEY,49.7,time 2,candidate,You'll get your chance in a moment.
ROMNEY,49.7,time 3,candidate,We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.
ROMNEY,49.8,time 2,candidate,I'm still speaking.
ROMNEY,49.8,time 3,candidate,"But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong."
ROMNEY,49.9,time 3,candidate,America must lead.
ROMNEY,51.1,time 2,candidate,And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case|
ROMNEY,52.1,time 1,candidate,Well|
ROMNEY,53.1,time 2,candidate,That wasn't the question.
ROMNEY,53.1,time 3,candidate,I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the future.
ROMNEY,53.1,time 3,candidate,"Number two, we're going to increase our trade."
ROMNEY,53.11,time 3,candidate,Trade grows about twelve percent year.
ROMNEY,53.12,time 3,candidate,It doubles about every every five or so years.
ROMNEY,53.13,time 3,candidate,"We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America."
ROMNEY,53.14,time 3,candidate,The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.
ROMNEY,53.15,time 3,candidate,"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China."
ROMNEY,53.16,time 3,candidate,We're all focused on China.
ROMNEY,53.17,time 3,candidate,"Latin America is a huge opportunity for us time zone, language opportunities."
ROMNEY,53.18,time 3,candidate,"Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind."
ROMNEY,53.19,time 3,candidate,And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.
ROMNEY,53.2,time 3,candidate,"And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create twelve million new jobs and rising take home pay."
ROMNEY,53.2,time 3,candidate,We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.
ROMNEY,53.21,time 3,candidate,And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.
ROMNEY,53.22,time 3,candidate,And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.
ROMNEY,53.23,time 3,candidate,"And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business."
ROMNEY,53.24,time 3,candidate,Small business is where jobs come from.
ROMNEY,53.25,time 3,candidate,Two thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.
ROMNEY,53.26,time 3,candidate,New business formation is down to the lowest level in thirty years under this administration.
ROMNEY,53.27,time 3,candidate,I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take home pay.
ROMNEY,53.3,time 3,candidate,And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.
ROMNEY,53.4,time 3,candidate,The president said by now we'd be a five.
ROMNEY,53.5,time 3,candidate,four percent unemployment.
ROMNEY,53.6,time 3,candidate,We're nine million jobs short of that.
ROMNEY,53.7,time 3,candidate,"I will get America working again and see rising take home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps."
ROMNEY,53.8,time 3,candidate,"Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence."
ROMNEY,53.9,time 3,candidate,"We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables."
ROMNEY,54.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, actually it's it's it's a lengthy description."
ROMNEY,54.1,time 1,candidate,"Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe."
ROMNEY,54.11,time 1,candidate,This is the private market.
ROMNEY,54.12,time 1,candidate,"These are small these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs."
ROMNEY,54.13,time 1,candidate,"I used to consult to businesses excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers."
ROMNEY,54.14,time 1,candidate,I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.
ROMNEY,54.15,time 1,candidate,"In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of fifteen people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have."
ROMNEY,54.16,time 1,candidate,"We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening."
ROMNEY,54.17,time 1,candidate,"Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others."
ROMNEY,54.18,time 1,candidate,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have."
ROMNEY,54.19,time 1,candidate,That's the wrong way to go.
ROMNEY,54.2,time 1,candidate,"But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan."
ROMNEY,54.2,time 1,candidate,The private market and individual responsibility always work best.
ROMNEY,54.3,time 1,candidate,"Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan."
ROMNEY,54.4,time 1,candidate,That's already offered in the private marketplace.
ROMNEY,54.5,time 1,candidate,You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.
ROMNEY,54.6,time 1,candidate,"But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families."
ROMNEY,54.7,time 1,candidate,"And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have."
ROMNEY,54.8,time 1,candidate,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in in bringing down the cost of almost anything."
ROMNEY,54.9,time 1,candidate,"As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be."
ROMNEY,55.1,time 2,candidate,That was a statement.
ROMNEY,55.1,time 2,candidate,a gallon.
ROMNEY,55.11,time 2,candidate,The price of electricity is up.
ROMNEY,55.12,time 2,candidate,"If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down."
ROMNEY,55.13,time 2,candidate,"I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure."
ROMNEY,55.14,time 2,candidate,"And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it."
ROMNEY,55.15,time 2,candidate,Those things will get us the energy we need.
ROMNEY,55.2,time 2,candidate,I don't think the American people believe that.
ROMNEY,55.3,time 2,candidate,"I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas."
ROMNEY,55.4,time 2,candidate,"And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump."
ROMNEY,55.5,time 2,candidate,"If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working."
ROMNEY,55.6,time 2,candidate,But you're paying more.
ROMNEY,55.7,time 2,candidate,"When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about dollar one."
ROMNEY,55.8,time 2,candidate,eighty six a gallon.
ROMNEY,55.9,time 2,candidate,"Now, it's dollar four."
ROMNEY,56.1,time 3,candidate,"Well well, I need to speak a moment|"
ROMNEY,57.1,time 1,candidate,No.
ROMNEY,57.2,time 1,candidate,I I have to respond to that.
ROMNEY,58.1,time 3,candidate,"if you'll let me, Bob, just about education|"
ROMNEY,59.1,time 1,candidate,"Which is which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and and lay down a piece of legislation and say, It's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done."
ROMNEY,59.1,time 1,candidate,"One way, for instance, would be to have a single number."
ROMNEY,59.1,time 2,candidate,He gets the first.
ROMNEY,59.11,time 1,candidate,"Make up a number, dollar twenty five thousand, dollar fifty thousand."
ROMNEY,59.12,time 1,candidate,Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.
ROMNEY,59.13,time 1,candidate,And then that number disappears for high income people.
ROMNEY,59.14,time 1,candidate,That's one way one could do it.
ROMNEY,59.15,time 1,candidate,One could follow Bowles Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.
ROMNEY,59.16,time 1,candidate,"There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth."
ROMNEY,59.17,time 1,candidate,"And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre existing condition plan."
ROMNEY,59.18,time 1,candidate,You obviously studied up on on my plan.
ROMNEY,59.19,time 1,candidate,"In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre existing conditions."
ROMNEY,59.2,time 1,candidate,What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.
ROMNEY,59.2,time 1,candidate,That's part of my health care plan.
ROMNEY,59.21,time 1,candidate,And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.
ROMNEY,59.22,time 1,candidate,And I said that at that time.
ROMNEY,59.23,time 1,candidate,"The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the tenth Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy."
ROMNEY,59.3,time 1,candidate,"When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster."
ROMNEY,59.4,time 1,candidate,He said he was going to lower tax rates.
ROMNEY,59.5,time 1,candidate,He said he was going to broaden the base.
ROMNEY,59.6,time 1,candidate,"You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base."
ROMNEY,59.7,time 1,candidate,Those are my principles.
ROMNEY,59.8,time 1,candidate,I want to bring down the tax burden on middle income families.
ROMNEY,59.9,time 1,candidate,"And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?"
ROMNEY,60.1,time 3,candidate,because I'm I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.
ROMNEY,60.2,time 3,candidate,We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing.
ROMNEY,60.3,time 3,candidate,Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.
ROMNEY,60.4,time 3,candidate,"While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all fifty states in English, and then also in math."
ROMNEY,60.5,time 3,candidate,And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.
ROMNEY,60.6,time 3,candidate,First time one state had been number one in all four measures.
ROMNEY,60.7,time 3,candidate,How did we do that?
ROMNEY,60.8,time 3,candidate,"Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom."
ROMNEY,61.1,time 2,candidate,He actually got|
ROMNEY,62.1,time 3,candidate,And that was that was that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.
ROMNEY,63.1,time 2,candidate,He actually got the first question.
ROMNEY,63.2,time 2,candidate,So I get the last question last answer|
ROMNEY,64.1,time 3,candidate,And then you cut education spending when you came into office.
ROMNEY,64.2,time 3,candidate,The first the first the first and we kept our schools number one in the nation.
ROMNEY,64.3,time 3,candidate,They're still number one today.
ROMNEY,65.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, first, I love great schools."
ROMNEY,65.1,time 1,candidate,"We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none."
ROMNEY,65.1,time 2,candidate,"Candy, Candy|"
ROMNEY,65.11,time 1,candidate,I do not believe in cutting our military.
ROMNEY,65.12,time 1,candidate,I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.
ROMNEY,65.13,time 1,candidate,"Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country."
ROMNEY,65.14,time 1,candidate,That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.
ROMNEY,65.15,time 1,candidate,"I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by by one another."
ROMNEY,65.16,time 1,candidate,"We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled."
ROMNEY,65.17,time 1,candidate,We care for them.
ROMNEY,65.18,time 1,candidate,"And we we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens."
ROMNEY,65.19,time 1,candidate,But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.
ROMNEY,65.2,time 1,candidate,"Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all fifty states."
ROMNEY,65.2,time 1,candidate,"And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a a trickle down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their drea Miss And it's not working."
ROMNEY,65.21,time 1,candidate,And the proof of that is twenty three million people out of work.
ROMNEY,65.22,time 1,candidate,The proof of that is one out of six people in poverty.
ROMNEY,65.23,time 1,candidate,The proof of that is we've gone from thirty two million on food stamps to forty seven million on food stamps.
ROMNEY,65.24,time 1,candidate,The proof of that is that fifty percent of college graduates this year can't find work.
ROMNEY,65.3,time 1,candidate,"And the key to great schools, great teachers."
ROMNEY,65.4,time 1,candidate,So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.
ROMNEY,65.5,time 1,candidate,"Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own."
ROMNEY,65.6,time 1,candidate,The role of government: Look behind us.
ROMNEY,65.7,time 1,candidate,The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
ROMNEY,65.8,time 1,candidate,The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.
ROMNEY,65.9,time 1,candidate,"First, life and liberty."
ROMNEY,66.1,time 3,candidate,"And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four year tuition free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning."
ROMNEY,67.1,time 1,candidate,We know that the path we're taking is not working.
ROMNEY,67.1,time 2,candidate,"Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that they're not phantom jobs."
ROMNEY,67.2,time 1,candidate,It's time for a new path.
ROMNEY,67.2,time 2,candidate,They're real jobs.
ROMNEY,69.1,time 1,candidate,"Well, the primary responsibility for education is is, of course, at the state and local level."
ROMNEY,69.1,time 2,candidate,I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.
ROMNEY,69.1,time 3,candidate,"That was actually mine, actually, Mister President."
ROMNEY,69.2,time 1,candidate,But the federal government also can play a very important role.
ROMNEY,69.2,time 2,candidate,I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.
ROMNEY,69.2,time 3,candidate,You got that fact wrong.
ROMNEY,69.3,time 1,candidate,"And I and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and and congratulate him for pursuing that."
ROMNEY,69.3,time 2,candidate,I'm going to make sure|
ROMNEY,69.4,time 1,candidate,The federal government can get local and and state schools to do a better job.
ROMNEY,69.5,time 1,candidate,"My own view, by the way, is I've added to that."
ROMNEY,69.6,time 1,candidate,"I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I these are disabled kids or or or poor kids or or lower income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice."
ROMNEY,69.7,time 1,candidate,"So all federal funds, instead of going to the to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their their their student."
ROMNEY,71.1,time 2,candidate,we're taking advantage of our energy resources.
ROMNEY,71.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way all the way through."
ROMNEY,71.2,time 2,candidate,We'll bring back manufacturing to America.
ROMNEY,71.2,time 3,candidate,"First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning we're going to cut about five percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military."
ROMNEY,71.3,time 2,candidate,"We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, thirty one/two million more jobs in this country."
ROMNEY,71.3,time 3,candidate,That's number one.
ROMNEY,71.4,time 2,candidate,It's critical to our future.
ROMNEY,73.1,time 3,candidate,The good news is.
ROMNEY,73.1,time 3,candidate,"We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them."
ROMNEY,73.11,time 3,candidate,"Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently."
ROMNEY,73.12,time 3,candidate,"As a governor, I thought please, give me this program."
ROMNEY,73.13,time 3,candidate,"I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it."
ROMNEY,73.14,time 3,candidate,"States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost effectively."
ROMNEY,73.15,time 3,candidate,I want to do those two things and get this get this to a balanced budget with eight eight to ten years.
ROMNEY,73.16,time 3,candidate,"But the military let's get back to the military, though."
ROMNEY,73.2,time 3,candidate,I'd be happy to have you take a look.
ROMNEY,73.3,time 3,candidate,Come on our website.
ROMNEY,73.4,time 3,candidate,You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to ten years.
ROMNEY,73.5,time 3,candidate,"We do it by getting by reducing spending in a whole series of progra Miss By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare."
ROMNEY,73.6,time 3,candidate,"There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them."
ROMNEY,73.7,time 3,candidate,And that one doesn't sound good and it's not affordable.
ROMNEY,73.8,time 3,candidate,So I'd get rid of that one from day one.
ROMNEY,73.9,time 3,candidate,"To the extent humanly possible, we get that out."
ROMNEY,76.1,time 2,candidate,"Hi, Mary."
ROMNEY,76.1,time 3,candidate,I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.
ROMNEY,76.2,time 3,candidate,I was on the world of business for twenty five years.
ROMNEY,76.3,time 3,candidate,"If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business."
ROMNEY,76.4,time 3,candidate,"I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there."
ROMNEY,76.5,time 3,candidate,I had the chance to be governor of a state.
ROMNEY,76.6,time 3,candidate,"Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget."
ROMNEY,76.7,time 3,candidate,We cut taxes nineteen times and balanced our budget.
ROMNEY,76.8,time 3,candidate,The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.
ROMNEY,76.9,time 3,candidate,I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.
ROMNEY,77.1,time 1,candidate,"Mister President, Mister President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts."
ROMNEY,77.1,time 1,candidate,dollar ninety billion.
ROMNEY,77.11,time 1,candidate,"And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business."
ROMNEY,77.12,time 1,candidate,A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.
ROMNEY,77.13,time 1,candidate,"Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world."
ROMNEY,77.14,time 1,candidate,"The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?"
ROMNEY,77.15,time 1,candidate,How do we get schools to be more competitive?
ROMNEY,77.16,time 1,candidate,Let's grade them.
ROMNEY,77.17,time 1,candidate,"I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a to a school that he's being more successful."
ROMNEY,77.18,time 1,candidate,I don't want to cut our commitment to education.
ROMNEY,77.19,time 1,candidate,I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.
ROMNEY,77.2,time 1,candidate,"All right, I'm not going to cut education funding."
ROMNEY,77.2,time 1,candidate,"And by the way, I've had that experience."
ROMNEY,77.21,time 1,candidate,I don't just talk about it.
ROMNEY,77.22,time 1,candidate,I've been there.
ROMNEY,77.23,time 1,candidate,Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.
ROMNEY,77.24,time 1,candidate,This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.
ROMNEY,77.25,time 1,candidate,It's because I care about education for all of our kids.
ROMNEY,77.3,time 1,candidate,I don't have any plan to cut education funding and and grants that go to people going to college.
ROMNEY,77.4,time 1,candidate,I'm planning on to grow.
ROMNEY,77.5,time 1,candidate,So I'm not planning on making changes there.
ROMNEY,77.6,time 1,candidate,"But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is."
ROMNEY,77.7,time 1,candidate,You put dollar ninety billion into into green jobs.
ROMNEY,77.8,time 1,candidate,"And I look, I'm all in favor of green energy."
ROMNEY,77.9,time 1,candidate,"dollar ninety billion, that would have that would have hired two million teachers."
ROMNEY,78.1,time 3,candidate,I'm going to be able to balance the budget.
ROMNEY,78.2,time 3,candidate,"Let's talk about military spending, and that's this."
ROMNEY,80.1,time 2,candidate,Thank you very much.
ROMNEY,80.1,time 2,candidate,That's part that's part one.
ROMNEY,80.1,time 3,candidate,"Our Navy is old excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since one thousand nine hundred seventeen."
ROMNEY,80.1,time 3,candidate,"Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people."
ROMNEY,80.11,time 2,candidate,"Now, how about deductions?"
ROMNEY,80.11,time 3,candidate,"And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts."
ROMNEY,80.12,time 2,candidate,"'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now."
ROMNEY,80.12,time 3,candidate,"That, in my view, is making is making our future less certain and less secure."
ROMNEY,80.13,time 2,candidate,The top five percent of taxpayers will continue to pay sixty percent of the income tax the nation collects.
ROMNEY,80.14,time 2,candidate,So that'll stay the same.
ROMNEY,80.15,time 2,candidate,Middle income people are going to get a tax break.
ROMNEY,80.16,time 2,candidate,"And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets I'll pick a number dollar twenty five thousand of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use."
ROMNEY,80.17,time 2,candidate,"Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions."
ROMNEY,80.18,time 2,candidate,"But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains."
ROMNEY,80.19,time 2,candidate,No tax on your savings.
ROMNEY,80.2,time 2,candidate,"And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle income taxpayers to have lower taxes."
ROMNEY,80.2,time 2,candidate,That makes life a lot easier.
ROMNEY,80.2,time 3,candidate,The Navy said they needed three hundred thirteen ships to carry out their mission.
ROMNEY,80.21,time 2,candidate,"If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making dollar two hundred thousand."
ROMNEY,80.22,time 2,candidate,"per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains."
ROMNEY,80.23,time 2,candidate,Why am I lowering taxes on the middle class?
ROMNEY,80.24,time 2,candidate,"Because under the last four years, they've been buried."
ROMNEY,80.25,time 2,candidate,And I want to help people in the middle class.
ROMNEY,80.26,time 2,candidate,"And I will not I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers."
ROMNEY,80.27,time 2,candidate,"And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle class."
ROMNEY,80.28,time 2,candidate,"The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people."
ROMNEY,80.29,time 2,candidate,Not just at the high end.
ROMNEY,80.3,time 2,candidate,And the reason I want middle income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.
ROMNEY,80.3,time 2,candidate,A recent study has shown the people in the middle class will see dollar four thousand.
ROMNEY,80.3,time 3,candidate,We're now at under two hundred eighty five.
ROMNEY,80.31,time 2,candidate,per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.
ROMNEY,80.32,time 2,candidate,I will not let that happen.
ROMNEY,80.33,time 2,candidate,"I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families."
ROMNEY,80.34,time 2,candidate,And what's that going to do?
ROMNEY,80.35,time 2,candidate,"It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country."
ROMNEY,80.4,time 2,candidate,"You've seen, as middle income people in this country, incomes go down dollar four thousand three hundred a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up dollar two thousand."
ROMNEY,80.4,time 3,candidate,We're headed down to the low two hundreds if we go through a sequestration.
ROMNEY,80.5,time 2,candidate,"Health insurance premiums, up dollar two thousand five hundred."
ROMNEY,80.5,time 3,candidate,That's unacceptable to me.
ROMNEY,80.6,time 2,candidate,Food prices up.
ROMNEY,80.6,time 3,candidate,I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.
ROMNEY,80.7,time 2,candidate,Utility prices up.
ROMNEY,80.7,time 3,candidate,Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in one thousand nine hundred forty seven.
ROMNEY,80.8,time 2,candidate,The middle income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.
ROMNEY,80.8,time 3,candidate,We've changed for the first time since FDR since FDR we had the we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.
ROMNEY,80.9,time 2,candidate,So I want to get some relief to middle income families.
ROMNEY,80.9,time 3,candidate,Now we're changing to one conflict.
ROMNEY,81.1,time 1,candidate,"Jim, I had the great experience it didn't seem like it at the time of being elected in a state where my legislature was eighty seven percent Democrat."
ROMNEY,81.2,time 1,candidate,And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.
ROMNEY,81.3,time 1,candidate,We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.
ROMNEY,81.4,time 1,candidate,We cut taxes nineteen times.
ROMNEY,83.1,time 1,candidate,"We as president, I will sit on day one actually, the day after I get elected I'll sit down with leaders the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue as we did in my state we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the in the in our state in that case."
ROMNEY,83.2,time 1,candidate,"We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground."
ROMNEY,83.3,time 1,candidate,"And the challenges America faces right now look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country."
ROMNEY,83.4,time 1,candidate,And we face this deficit could crush the future generations.
ROMNEY,83.5,time 1,candidate,"What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern."
ROMNEY,84.1,time 2,candidate,You're absolutely right.
ROMNEY,84.1,time 2,candidate,Fifty four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.
ROMNEY,84.11,time 2,candidate,"So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people."
ROMNEY,84.12,time 2,candidate,"For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment."
ROMNEY,84.13,time 2,candidate,We can do better than this.
ROMNEY,84.14,time 2,candidate,"We don't have to settle for, how many months, forty three months with unemployment above eight percent, twenty three million Americans struggling to find a good job right now."
ROMNEY,84.15,time 2,candidate,There are three.
ROMNEY,84.16,time 2,candidate,five million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.
ROMNEY,84.17,time 2,candidate,We don't have to live like this.
ROMNEY,84.18,time 2,candidate,We can get this economy going again.
ROMNEY,84.19,time 2,candidate,My five point plan does it.
ROMNEY,84.2,time 2,candidate,You heard what I said about my tax plan.
ROMNEY,84.2,time 2,candidate,Energy independence for North America in five years.
ROMNEY,84.21,time 2,candidate,"Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America."
ROMNEY,84.22,time 2,candidate,Cracking down on China when they cheat.
ROMNEY,84.23,time 2,candidate,Getting us to a balanced budget.
ROMNEY,84.24,time 2,candidate,Fixing our training programs for our workers.
ROMNEY,84.25,time 2,candidate,"And finally, championing small business."
ROMNEY,84.26,time 2,candidate,I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.
ROMNEY,84.27,time 2,candidate,I know how to make that happen.
ROMNEY,84.28,time 2,candidate,I spent my life in the private sector.
ROMNEY,84.29,time 2,candidate,I know why jobs come and why they go.
ROMNEY,84.3,time 2,candidate,"The top five percent will continue to pay sixty percent, as they do today."
ROMNEY,84.3,time 2,candidate,And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.
ROMNEY,84.4,time 2,candidate,I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.
ROMNEY,84.5,time 2,candidate,I am looking to cut taxes for middle income people.
ROMNEY,84.6,time 2,candidate,"And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?"
ROMNEY,84.7,time 2,candidate,"Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people."
ROMNEY,84.8,time 2,candidate,"And for me, this is about jobs."
ROMNEY,84.9,time 2,candidate,I want to get America's economy going again.
ROMNEY,85.1,time 1,candidate,And Republicans and Democrats both love America.
ROMNEY,85.2,time 1,candidate,But we need to have leadership leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
ROMNEY,85.3,time 1,candidate,I've done it before.
ROMNEY,85.4,time 1,candidate,I'll do it again.
ROMNEY,88.1,time 2,candidate,I I|
ROMNEY,89.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president made which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel."
ROMNEY,89.1,time 3,candidate,You're seeing it right now in the economy.
ROMNEY,89.11,time 3,candidate,"It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions."
ROMNEY,89.12,time 3,candidate,I would have put them in place earlier.
ROMNEY,89.13,time 3,candidate,But it's good that we have them.
ROMNEY,89.14,time 3,candidate,"Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions."
ROMNEY,89.15,time 3,candidate,"I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports."
ROMNEY,89.16,time 3,candidate,I imagine the E.
ROMNEY,89.17,time 3,candidate,U.
ROMNEY,89.18,time 3,candidate,would agree with us as well.
ROMNEY,89.19,time 3,candidate,"Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't."
ROMNEY,89.2,time 3,candidate,"And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily."
ROMNEY,89.2,time 3,candidate,I would tighten those sanctions further.
ROMNEY,89.21,time 3,candidate,"Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts."
ROMNEY,89.22,time 3,candidate,I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.
ROMNEY,89.23,time 3,candidate,His words amount to genocide incitation.
ROMNEY,89.24,time 3,candidate,I would indict him for it.
ROMNEY,89.25,time 3,candidate,I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.
ROMNEY,89.26,time 3,candidate,The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.
ROMNEY,89.27,time 3,candidate,"We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a a a solution to this, which says which stops this this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America."
ROMNEY,89.28,time 3,candidate,"And of course, a military action is the last resort."
ROMNEY,89.29,time 3,candidate,It is something one would only only consider if all of the other avenues had been had been tried to their full extent.
ROMNEY,89.3,time 3,candidate,That's number one.
ROMNEY,89.4,time 3,candidate,"Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear capable Iran is unacceptable to America."
ROMNEY,89.5,time 3,candidate,"It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us."
ROMNEY,89.6,time 3,candidate,"It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means."
ROMNEY,89.7,time 3,candidate,"And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference."
ROMNEY,89.8,time 3,candidate,"I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one."
ROMNEY,89.9,time 3,candidate,And they do work.
ROMNEY,90.1,time 2,candidate,Well of course they add up.
ROMNEY,90.1,time 2,candidate,"We've gone from dollar ten trillion of national debt, to dollar sixteen trillion of national debt."
ROMNEY,90.11,time 2,candidate,"If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost dollar twenty trillion of national debt."
ROMNEY,90.12,time 2,candidate,This puts us on a road to Greece.
ROMNEY,90.13,time 2,candidate,I know what it takes to balance budgets.
ROMNEY,90.14,time 2,candidate,I've done it my entire life.
ROMNEY,90.15,time 2,candidate,"So for instance when he says, Yours is a dollar five trillion cut."
ROMNEY,90.16,time 2,candidate,"Well, no it's not."
ROMNEY,90.17,time 2,candidate,Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.
ROMNEY,90.18,time 2,candidate,And|
ROMNEY,90.2,time 2,candidate,"I I was I was someone who ran businesses for twenty five years, and balanced the budget."
ROMNEY,90.3,time 2,candidate,I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.
ROMNEY,90.4,time 2,candidate,"I ran the the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years."
ROMNEY,90.5,time 2,candidate,"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about dollar four trillion of deficits over the last four years, dollar five trillion?"
ROMNEY,90.6,time 2,candidate,That's math that doesn't add up.
ROMNEY,90.7,time 2,candidate,We have we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.
ROMNEY,90.8,time 2,candidate,"And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half."
ROMNEY,90.9,time 2,candidate,Instead he's doubled it.
ROMNEY,92.1,time 2,candidate,"And I just described I just described to you, Mister President I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put and they can put they're they're deductions and credits|"
ROMNEY,93.1,time 1,candidate,"Thank you, Jim, and Mister President."
ROMNEY,93.1,time 1,candidate,We're talk about those two paths.
ROMNEY,93.1,time 3,candidate,"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be."
ROMNEY,93.1,time 3,candidate,"All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges."
ROMNEY,93.11,time 1,candidate,But they lead in very different directions.
ROMNEY,93.11,time 3,candidate,"Now there are some ten thousand centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world."
ROMNEY,93.12,time 1,candidate,And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.
ROMNEY,93.12,time 3,candidate,"That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable."
ROMNEY,93.13,time 1,candidate,You can look at the record.
ROMNEY,93.13,time 3,candidate,And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.
ROMNEY,93.14,time 1,candidate,There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.
ROMNEY,93.14,time 3,candidate,They must not develop nuclear capability.
ROMNEY,93.15,time 1,candidate,I'll get incomes up again.
ROMNEY,93.15,time 3,candidate,"And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible."
ROMNEY,93.16,time 1,candidate,You'll see chronic unemployment.
ROMNEY,93.16,time 3,candidate,They need to be tightened.
ROMNEY,93.17,time 1,candidate,We've had forty three straight months with unemployment above eight percent.
ROMNEY,93.17,time 3,candidate,Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.
ROMNEY,93.18,time 1,candidate,If I'm president I will create help create twelve million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.
ROMNEY,93.18,time 3,candidate,We need to indict Ahmadinejad.
ROMNEY,93.19,time 1,candidate,"If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed."
ROMNEY,93.19,time 3,candidate,"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action."
ROMNEY,93.2,time 1,candidate,And thank you for tuning in this evening.
ROMNEY,93.2,time 1,candidate,In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.
ROMNEY,93.2,time 3,candidate,I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.
ROMNEY,93.21,time 1,candidate,Many will lose it.
ROMNEY,93.22,time 1,candidate,You're going to see health premiums go up by some dollar two thousand five hundred per family.
ROMNEY,93.23,time 1,candidate,If I'm elected we won't have Obama.
ROMNEY,93.24,time 1,candidate,We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.
ROMNEY,93.25,time 1,candidate,If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a dollar seven hundred sixteen billion cut to Medicare.
ROMNEY,93.26,time 1,candidate,You'll have four million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.
ROMNEY,93.27,time 1,candidate,You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.
ROMNEY,93.28,time 1,candidate,I'll restore that dollar seven hundred sixteen billion to Medicare.
ROMNEY,93.29,time 1,candidate,"And finally, military."
ROMNEY,93.3,time 1,candidate,This is a this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.
ROMNEY,93.3,time 1,candidate,The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.
ROMNEY,93.3,time 3,candidate,"And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran."
ROMNEY,93.31,time 1,candidate,The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.
ROMNEY,93.32,time 1,candidate,I will not cut our commitment to our military.
ROMNEY,93.33,time 1,candidate,I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.
ROMNEY,93.34,time 1,candidate,"Thank you, Jim."
ROMNEY,93.4,time 1,candidate,I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.
ROMNEY,93.4,time 3,candidate,"And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States."
ROMNEY,93.5,time 1,candidate,I I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.
ROMNEY,93.5,time 3,candidate,"And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America."
ROMNEY,93.6,time 1,candidate,It's bigger than our respective parties.
ROMNEY,93.6,time 3,candidate,I think they looked at that and saw weakness.
ROMNEY,93.7,time 1,candidate,It's an election about the course of America.
ROMNEY,93.7,time 3,candidate,"Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent."
ROMNEY,93.8,time 1,candidate,What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.
ROMNEY,93.8,time 3,candidate,I think they noticed that as well.
ROMNEY,93.9,time 1,candidate,"And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate."
ROMNEY,93.9,time 3,candidate,"And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well."
ROMNEY,95.1,time 3,candidate,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.
ROMNEY,95.1,time 3,candidate,"Mister President, America has not dictated to other nations."
ROMNEY,95.11,time 3,candidate,We have freed other nations from dictators.
ROMNEY,95.2,time 3,candidate,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.
ROMNEY,95.3,time 3,candidate,And and we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.
ROMNEY,95.4,time 3,candidate,That's number one.
ROMNEY,95.5,time 3,candidate,"Number two, Mister President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq."
ROMNEY,95.6,time 3,candidate,"And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations."
ROMNEY,95.7,time 3,candidate,"And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel."
ROMNEY,95.8,time 3,candidate,"And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive."
ROMNEY,95.9,time 3,candidate,You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.
ROMNEY,98.1,time 2,candidate,Thank you.
ROMNEY,98.1,time 2,candidate,"But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible."
ROMNEY,98.1,time 3,candidate,"Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature."
ROMNEY,98.11,time 2,candidate,"My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school."
ROMNEY,98.12,time 2,candidate,"She said, I can't be here until seven or eight o'clock at night."
ROMNEY,98.13,time 2,candidate,I need to be able to get home at five o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.
ROMNEY,98.14,time 2,candidate,So we said fine.
ROMNEY,98.15,time 2,candidate,Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.
ROMNEY,98.16,time 2,candidate,"We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women."
ROMNEY,98.17,time 2,candidate,In the in the last women have lost five hundred eighty thousand jobs.
ROMNEY,98.18,time 2,candidate,That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.
ROMNEY,98.19,time 2,candidate,We're still down five hundred eighty thousand jobs.
ROMNEY,98.2,time 2,candidate,"And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men."
ROMNEY,98.2,time 2,candidate,"I mentioned thirty one/two million women, more now in poverty than four years ago."
ROMNEY,98.2,time 3,candidate,"Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way."
ROMNEY,98.21,time 2,candidate,"What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford."
ROMNEY,98.22,time 2,candidate,This is what I have done.
ROMNEY,98.23,time 2,candidate,"It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like."
ROMNEY,98.24,time 2,candidate,And an economy with seven.
ROMNEY,98.25,time 2,candidate,eight percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.
ROMNEY,98.26,time 2,candidate,An economy that has twenty three million people looking for work is not a strong economy.
ROMNEY,98.27,time 2,candidate,"An economy with fifty percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have."
ROMNEY,98.3,time 2,candidate,"And I and I went to my staff, and I said, How come all the people for these jobs are are all men."
ROMNEY,98.3,time 3,candidate,This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of |
ROMNEY,98.4,time 2,candidate,"They said, Well, these are the people that have the qualifications."
ROMNEY,98.5,time 2,candidate,"And I said, Well, gosh, can't we can't we find some some women that are also qualified?"
ROMNEY,98.6,time 2,candidate,And and so we we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.
ROMNEY,98.7,time 2,candidate,"I went to a number of women's groups and said, Can you help us find folks, and they brought us whole binders full of women."
ROMNEY,98.8,time 2,candidate,"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all fifty states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America."
ROMNEY,98.9,time 2,candidate,Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.
ROMNEY,100.1,time 2,candidate,I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.
ROMNEY,100.1,time 3,candidate,But let me let me come back we can come back.
ROMNEY,100.1,time 3,candidate,They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.
ROMNEY,100.11,time 3,candidate,"I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world."
ROMNEY,100.12,time 3,candidate,"I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the the the turmoil with Israel."
ROMNEY,100.13,time 3,candidate,"I mean, the president received a letter from thirty eight Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem."
ROMNEY,100.14,time 3,candidate,"They asked him, please repair the tension Democrat senators please repair the tension|"
ROMNEY,100.2,time 3,candidate,"Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well."
ROMNEY,100.3,time 3,candidate,"Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb."
ROMNEY,100.4,time 3,candidate,"I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult."
ROMNEY,100.5,time 3,candidate,"I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there."
ROMNEY,100.6,time 3,candidate,They're very strong.
ROMNEY,100.7,time 3,candidate,"I see Syria with thirty thousand civilians dead, Assad still in power."
ROMNEY,100.8,time 3,candidate,"I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's growing larger every year, as a matter of fact."
ROMNEY,100.9,time 3,candidate,"I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn Lugar any more."
ROMNEY,102.1,time 3,candidate,the damage in his in his own party.
ROMNEY,105.1,time 3,candidate,Bob|
ROMNEY,107.1,time 2,candidate,Thank you.
ROMNEY,107.1,time 3,candidate,You can't but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.
ROMNEY,107.2,time 2,candidate,And I appreciate that question.
ROMNEY,107.3,time 2,candidate,"I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe|"
ROMNEY,109.1,time 2,candidate,I don't believe|
ROMNEY,109.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, that's probably true."
ROMNEY,111.1,time 2,candidate,The time the time|
ROMNEY,111.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, we're going to be finished by two thousand fourteen, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of two thousand fourteen."
ROMNEY,111.1,time 3,candidate,"But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has one hundred nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more."
ROMNEY,111.11,time 3,candidate,They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the in the relatively near future.
ROMNEY,111.12,time 3,candidate,They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.
ROMNEY,111.13,time 3,candidate,"And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us."
ROMNEY,111.14,time 3,candidate,And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.
ROMNEY,111.15,time 3,candidate,And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.
ROMNEY,111.16,time 3,candidate,"So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of two thousand fourteen."
ROMNEY,111.2,time 3,candidate,The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.
ROMNEY,111.3,time 3,candidate,We've seen progress over the past several years.
ROMNEY,111.4,time 3,candidate,The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.
ROMNEY,111.5,time 3,candidate,"There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, three hundred fifty thousand that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of two thousand fourteen."
ROMNEY,111.6,time 3,candidate,So our troops will come home at that point.
ROMNEY,111.7,time 3,candidate,"I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan."
ROMNEY,111.8,time 3,candidate,And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.
ROMNEY,111.9,time 3,candidate,"And I don't mean you, Mister President, but some people in the in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem."
ROMNEY,113.1,time 2,candidate,I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.
ROMNEY,113.2,time 2,candidate,And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.
ROMNEY,113.3,time 2,candidate,Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.
ROMNEY,113.4,time 2,candidate,And and the and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.
ROMNEY,115.1,time 2,candidate,Let me come back and and answer your question.
ROMNEY,115.1,time 2,candidate,President Bush didn't.
ROMNEY,115.1,time 3,candidate,"No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has one hundred nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network."
ROMNEY,115.1,time 3,candidate,We we had to go into Pakistan.
ROMNEY,115.11,time 2,candidate,"President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years."
ROMNEY,115.11,time 3,candidate,We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.
ROMNEY,115.12,time 2,candidate,"He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years."
ROMNEY,115.12,time 3,candidate,That was the right thing to do.
ROMNEY,115.13,time 2,candidate,"And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large."
ROMNEY,115.13,time 3,candidate,"And and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that."
ROMNEY,115.14,time 2,candidate,So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.
ROMNEY,115.14,time 3,candidate,But we're going to have to work with the with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.
ROMNEY,115.15,time 2,candidate,"And then let's take the last one, championing small business."
ROMNEY,115.15,time 3,candidate,And it's important for them.
ROMNEY,115.16,time 2,candidate,Our party has been focused too long.
ROMNEY,115.16,time 3,candidate,It's important for the nuclear weapons.
ROMNEY,115.17,time 2,candidate,I came through small business.
ROMNEY,115.17,time 3,candidate,It's important for the success of Afghanistan.
ROMNEY,115.18,time 2,candidate,I understand how hard it is to start a small business.
ROMNEY,115.18,time 3,candidate,"Because inside Pakistan, you have a a large group of Pashtun that are that are Taliban."
ROMNEY,115.19,time 2,candidate,That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.
ROMNEY,115.19,time 3,candidate,They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.
ROMNEY,115.2,time 2,candidate,President Bush and I are are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.
ROMNEY,115.2,time 2,candidate,I want to keep their taxes down on small business.
ROMNEY,115.2,time 3,candidate,It's a nation that's not like like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.
ROMNEY,115.2,time 3,candidate,And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.
ROMNEY,115.21,time 2,candidate,"I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it."
ROMNEY,115.21,time 3,candidate,But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.
ROMNEY,115.22,time 2,candidate,"And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people."
ROMNEY,115.22,time 3,candidate,"But we do need to make sure that as we as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society."
ROMNEY,115.23,time 2,candidate,My priority is jobs.
ROMNEY,115.24,time 2,candidate,I know how to make that happen.
ROMNEY,115.25,time 2,candidate,And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.
ROMNEY,115.26,time 2,candidate,My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.
ROMNEY,115.3,time 2,candidate,"I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else."
ROMNEY,115.3,time 3,candidate,"You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the of three branches there."
ROMNEY,115.4,time 2,candidate,"That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America become energy secure."
ROMNEY,115.4,time 3,candidate,Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.
ROMNEY,115.5,time 2,candidate,"Number two, trade I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't."
ROMNEY,115.5,time 3,candidate,"This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got you've got terrorists there who could grab their their hands onto those nuclear weapons."
ROMNEY,115.6,time 2,candidate,I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.
ROMNEY,115.6,time 3,candidate,This is this is an important part of the world for us.
ROMNEY,115.7,time 2,candidate,It's been growing about twelve percent per year over a long period of time.
ROMNEY,115.7,time 3,candidate,"Pakistan is is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now."
ROMNEY,115.8,time 2,candidate,I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.
ROMNEY,115.8,time 3,candidate,But we have some work to do.
ROMNEY,115.9,time 2,candidate,"Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget."
ROMNEY,115.9,time 3,candidate,And I I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.
ROMNEY,117.1,time 3,candidate,Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.
ROMNEY,117.1,time 3,candidate,Yes.
ROMNEY,117.11,time 3,candidate,"Is is al Qaida on he run, on its heels?"
ROMNEY,117.12,time 3,candidate,No.
ROMNEY,117.13,time 3,candidate,Is are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?
ROMNEY,117.14,time 3,candidate,"No, they haven't had talks in two years."
ROMNEY,117.15,time 3,candidate,"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands."
ROMNEY,117.2,time 3,candidate,"And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends."
ROMNEY,117.3,time 3,candidate,"But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and and killing bad guys, important as that is."
ROMNEY,117.4,time 3,candidate,We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.
ROMNEY,117.5,time 3,candidate,We haven't done that yet.
ROMNEY,117.6,time 3,candidate,"We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the the record, you look at the record."
ROMNEY,117.7,time 3,candidate,You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?
ROMNEY,117.8,time 3,candidate,Yes.
ROMNEY,117.9,time 3,candidate,Is the Middle East in tumult?
ROMNEY,122.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful."
ROMNEY,122.1,time 3,candidate,And so we can be a partner with China.
ROMNEY,122.11,time 3,candidate,"We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form."
ROMNEY,122.12,time 3,candidate,"We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible."
ROMNEY,122.13,time 3,candidate,"Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?"
ROMNEY,122.14,time 3,candidate,How strong are we going to be?
ROMNEY,122.15,time 3,candidate,How strong is our economy?
ROMNEY,122.16,time 3,candidate,"They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people dollar sixteen trillion in total, including that."
ROMNEY,122.17,time 3,candidate,They look at our our decision to to cut back on our military capabilities.
ROMNEY,122.18,time 3,candidate,A trillion dollars.
ROMNEY,122.19,time 3,candidate,The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.
ROMNEY,122.2,time 3,candidate,It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.
ROMNEY,122.2,time 3,candidate,"It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating."
ROMNEY,122.21,time 3,candidate,"It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating."
ROMNEY,122.22,time 3,candidate,"They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK."
ROMNEY,122.23,time 3,candidate,Is America going to be strong?
ROMNEY,122.24,time 3,candidate,"And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong."
ROMNEY,122.25,time 3,candidate,We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.
ROMNEY,122.26,time 3,candidate,"I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency."
ROMNEY,122.27,time 3,candidate,It holds down the prices of their goods.
ROMNEY,122.28,time 3,candidate,It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.
ROMNEY,122.29,time 3,candidate,That's got to end.
ROMNEY,122.3,time 3,candidate,"Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran."
ROMNEY,122.3,time 3,candidate,They're making some progress; they need to make more.
ROMNEY,122.31,time 3,candidate,"That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs."
ROMNEY,122.32,time 3,candidate,"They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods."
ROMNEY,122.33,time 3,candidate,They have to understand we want to trade with them.
ROMNEY,122.34,time 3,candidate,We want a world that's stable.
ROMNEY,122.35,time 3,candidate,"We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."
ROMNEY,122.4,time 3,candidate,Let's talk about China.
ROMNEY,122.5,time 3,candidate,"China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world."
ROMNEY,122.6,time 3,candidate,They don't want war.
ROMNEY,122.7,time 3,candidate,They don't want to see protectionism.
ROMNEY,122.8,time 3,candidate,"They don't want to see the world break out into into various forms of chaos, because they have to they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about twenty thousand twenty million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs."
ROMNEY,122.9,time 3,candidate,So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.
ROMNEY,124.1,time 3,candidate,"Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year."
ROMNEY,124.1,time 3,candidate,But this can't keep on going.
ROMNEY,124.11,time 3,candidate,"You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States."
ROMNEY,124.12,time 3,candidate,"I was with one company that makes valves and and process industries and they said, look, we were we were having some valves coming in that that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and and they had our serial number on them."
ROMNEY,124.13,time 3,candidate,And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.
ROMNEY,124.14,time 3,candidate,They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.
ROMNEY,124.15,time 3,candidate,S.
ROMNEY,124.16,time 3,candidate,"company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U."
ROMNEY,124.17,time 3,candidate,S.
ROMNEY,124.18,time 3,candidate,competitor.
ROMNEY,124.19,time 3,candidate,This can't go on.
ROMNEY,124.2,time 3,candidate,So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.
ROMNEY,124.2,time 3,candidate,I want a great relationship with China.
ROMNEY,124.21,time 3,candidate,"China can be our partner, but but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis."
ROMNEY,124.3,time 3,candidate,"And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it."
ROMNEY,124.4,time 3,candidate,It's a silent one.
ROMNEY,124.5,time 3,candidate,And they're winning.
ROMNEY,124.6,time 3,candidate,"We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before."
ROMNEY,124.7,time 3,candidate,And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.
ROMNEY,124.8,time 3,candidate,"We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively."
ROMNEY,124.9,time 3,candidate,We understand it.
ROMNEY,126.1,time 2,candidate,I think you know better.
ROMNEY,126.1,time 2,candidate,I wasn't the one that said five.
ROMNEY,126.1,time 3,candidate,"I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country."
ROMNEY,126.1,time 3,candidate,auto industry.
ROMNEY,126.11,time 2,candidate,four percent.
ROMNEY,126.11,time 3,candidate,My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.
ROMNEY,126.12,time 2,candidate,This was the president's plan.
ROMNEY,126.12,time 3,candidate,It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.
ROMNEY,126.13,time 2,candidate,Didn't get there.
ROMNEY,126.13,time 3,candidate,I disagree with that.
ROMNEY,126.14,time 2,candidate,"He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy."
ROMNEY,126.14,time 3,candidate,I said they need these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.
ROMNEY,126.15,time 2,candidate,He would reform them.
ROMNEY,126.15,time 3,candidate,"And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd they'd built up."
ROMNEY,126.16,time 2,candidate,He'd get that done.
ROMNEY,126.16,time 3,candidate,And fortunately|
ROMNEY,126.17,time 2,candidate,He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.
ROMNEY,126.18,time 2,candidate,He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.
ROMNEY,126.19,time 2,candidate,Didn't even file it.
ROMNEY,126.2,time 2,candidate,I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.
ROMNEY,126.2,time 2,candidate,This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.
ROMNEY,126.2,time 3,candidate,But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.
ROMNEY,126.21,time 2,candidate,He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.
ROMNEY,126.22,time 2,candidate,He hasn't done that either.
ROMNEY,126.23,time 2,candidate,"In fact, he doubled it."
ROMNEY,126.24,time 2,candidate,He said that by now middle income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by dollar two thousand five hundred a year.
ROMNEY,126.25,time 2,candidate,It's gone up by dollar two thousand five hundred a year.
ROMNEY,126.26,time 2,candidate,"And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented it's already been passed if it's implemented fully, it'll be another dollar two thousand five hundred on top."
ROMNEY,126.27,time 2,candidate,The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.
ROMNEY,126.28,time 2,candidate,"He keeps saying, Look, I've created five million jobs."
ROMNEY,126.29,time 2,candidate,That's after losing five million jobs.
ROMNEY,126.3,time 2,candidate,"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get."
ROMNEY,126.3,time 2,candidate,The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.
ROMNEY,126.3,time 3,candidate,Nothing could be further from the truth.
ROMNEY,126.31,time 2,candidate,"The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still twenty three million Americans."
ROMNEY,126.32,time 2,candidate,"There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty."
ROMNEY,126.33,time 2,candidate,How about food stamps?
ROMNEY,126.34,time 2,candidate,"When he took office, thirty two million people were on food stamps."
ROMNEY,126.35,time 2,candidate,"Today, forty seven million people are on food stamps."
ROMNEY,126.36,time 2,candidate,How about the growth of the economy?
ROMNEY,126.37,time 2,candidate,"It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before."
ROMNEY,126.38,time 2,candidate,The president wants to do well.
ROMNEY,126.39,time 2,candidate,I understand.
ROMNEY,126.4,time 2,candidate,You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.
ROMNEY,126.4,time 2,candidate,"But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have."
ROMNEY,126.4,time 3,candidate,I'm a son of Detroit.
ROMNEY,126.41,time 2,candidate,"You might say, Well, you got an example of one that worked better?"
ROMNEY,126.42,time 2,candidate,"Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit ten."
ROMNEY,126.43,time 2,candidate,"eight percent, between that period the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery."
ROMNEY,126.44,time 2,candidate,Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.
ROMNEY,126.45,time 2,candidate,And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.
ROMNEY,126.46,time 2,candidate,"The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked."
ROMNEY,126.47,time 2,candidate,He's great as a as a as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.
ROMNEY,126.48,time 2,candidate,"That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at."
ROMNEY,126.49,time 2,candidate,"And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need."
ROMNEY,126.5,time 2,candidate,We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.
ROMNEY,126.5,time 2,candidate,Median income is down dollar four thousand three hundred a family and twenty three million Americans out of work.
ROMNEY,126.5,time 3,candidate,I was born in Detroit.
ROMNEY,126.51,time 2,candidate,That's what this election is about.
ROMNEY,126.52,time 2,candidate,It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.
ROMNEY,126.6,time 2,candidate,He said that by now we'd have unemployment at five.
ROMNEY,126.6,time 3,candidate,My dad was head of a car company.
ROMNEY,126.7,time 2,candidate,four percent.
ROMNEY,126.7,time 3,candidate,I like American cars.
ROMNEY,126.8,time 2,candidate,The difference between where it is and five.
ROMNEY,126.8,time 3,candidate,And I would do nothing to hurt the U.
ROMNEY,126.9,time 2,candidate,four percent is nine million Americans without work.
ROMNEY,126.9,time 3,candidate,S.
ROMNEY,128.1,time 3,candidate,You can take a look at the op ed|
ROMNEY,130.1,time 2,candidate,Is it Loraina?
ROMNEY,130.1,time 3,candidate,"I said that we would provide guarantees, and and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy."
ROMNEY,130.2,time 3,candidate,Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.
ROMNEY,130.3,time 3,candidate,"And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not."
ROMNEY,130.4,time 3,candidate,Of course not.
ROMNEY,132.1,time 2,candidate,Lorraine?
ROMNEY,132.1,time 3,candidate,That's the height of silliness|
ROMNEY,134.1,time 2,candidate,Lorraine.
ROMNEY,134.1,time 3,candidate,I have never said I would liquidate|
ROMNEY,136.1,time 2,candidate,"Good, thanks."
ROMNEY,136.1,time 3,candidate,I would liquidate the industry.
ROMNEY,138.1,time 2,candidate,Thank you.
ROMNEY,138.1,time 2,candidate,We welcome legal immigrants into this country.
ROMNEY,138.1,time 3,candidate,and and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.
ROMNEY,138.1,time 3,candidate,But investing in companies?
ROMNEY,138.11,time 2,candidate,I want our legal system to work better.
ROMNEY,138.11,time 3,candidate,Absolutely not.
ROMNEY,138.12,time 2,candidate,I want it to be streamlined.
ROMNEY,138.13,time 2,candidate,I want it to be clearer.
ROMNEY,138.14,time 2,candidate,I don't think you have to shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.
ROMNEY,138.15,time 2,candidate,"I also think that we should give visas to people green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need."
ROMNEY,138.16,time 2,candidate,"People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U."
ROMNEY,138.17,time 2,candidate,S.
ROMNEY,138.18,time 2,candidate,of A.
ROMNEY,138.19,time 2,candidate,We should make sure our legal system works.
ROMNEY,138.2,time 2,candidate,Lorraine?
ROMNEY,138.2,time 2,candidate,"Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration."
ROMNEY,138.2,time 3,candidate,"We in this country can can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to."
ROMNEY,138.21,time 2,candidate,There are four million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.
ROMNEY,138.22,time 2,candidate,Those who've come here illegally take their place.
ROMNEY,138.23,time 2,candidate,So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.
ROMNEY,138.24,time 2,candidate,What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.
ROMNEY,138.25,time 2,candidate,I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.
ROMNEY,138.26,time 2,candidate,"So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would."
ROMNEY,138.27,time 2,candidate,"The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident."
ROMNEY,138.28,time 2,candidate,"Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration."
ROMNEY,138.29,time 2,candidate,He didn't do it.
ROMNEY,138.3,time 2,candidate,Did I get that right?
ROMNEY,138.3,time 2,candidate,"He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses."
ROMNEY,138.3,time 3,candidate,"We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in in car companies like Tesla and and Fisker, making electric battery cars."
ROMNEY,138.31,time 2,candidate,Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?
ROMNEY,138.32,time 2,candidate,What's a question I think the the president will have a chance to answer right now.
ROMNEY,138.4,time 2,candidate,Good.
ROMNEY,138.4,time 3,candidate,"This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies."
ROMNEY,138.5,time 2,candidate,Thank you for your question.
ROMNEY,138.5,time 3,candidate,Investing in Solyndra.
ROMNEY,138.6,time 2,candidate,And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.
ROMNEY,138.6,time 3,candidate,"This is a company, this isn't basic research."
ROMNEY,138.7,time 2,candidate,"But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants."
ROMNEY,138.7,time 3,candidate,I I want to invest in research.
ROMNEY,138.8,time 2,candidate,We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.
ROMNEY,138.8,time 3,candidate,Research is great.
ROMNEY,138.9,time 2,candidate,My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first generation American.
ROMNEY,138.9,time 3,candidate,Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.
ROMNEY,140.1,time 3,candidate,That's the wrong way to go.
ROMNEY,141.1,time 2,candidate,Yes.
ROMNEY,142.1,time 3,candidate,I'm still speaking.
ROMNEY,142.2,time 3,candidate,So I want to make sure that we make we make America more competitive.
ROMNEY,143.1,time 2,candidate,"No, let let let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and and and let's get them correct."
ROMNEY,143.1,time 2,candidate,He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.
ROMNEY,143.11,time 2,candidate,"I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't."
ROMNEY,143.12,time 2,candidate,Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.
ROMNEY,143.13,time 2,candidate,"In his first year, I was just getting licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right."
ROMNEY,143.14,time 2,candidate,I was not the standard bearer.
ROMNEY,143.15,time 2,candidate,My my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.
ROMNEY,143.16,time 2,candidate,"Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self deportation says let people make their own choice."
ROMNEY,143.17,time 2,candidate,"What I was saying is, we're not going to round up twelve million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation."
ROMNEY,143.18,time 2,candidate,Instead let people make their own choice.
ROMNEY,143.19,time 2,candidate,"And if they if they find that that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where where they have better opportunities."
ROMNEY,143.2,time 2,candidate,I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.
ROMNEY,143.2,time 2,candidate,But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and and and taking them out of this country.
ROMNEY,143.21,time 2,candidate,"I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country."
ROMNEY,143.22,time 2,candidate,Let me mention something else the president said.
ROMNEY,143.23,time 2,candidate,"It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth."
ROMNEY,143.3,time 2,candidate,"I said that the E Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation."
ROMNEY,143.4,time 2,candidate,That's number one.
ROMNEY,143.5,time 2,candidate,"Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked."
ROMNEY,143.6,time 2,candidate,He was asked this on Univision the other day.
ROMNEY,143.7,time 2,candidate,"Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?"
ROMNEY,143.8,time 2,candidate,And he didn't answer.
ROMNEY,143.9,time 2,candidate,He he doesn't answer that question.
ROMNEY,144.1,time 3,candidate,"And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow."
ROMNEY,144.2,time 3,candidate,But you're investing in companies doesn't do that.
ROMNEY,144.3,time 3,candidate,In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here|
ROMNEY,145.1,time 2,candidate,"Mister President, I'm still speaking."
ROMNEY,145.2,time 2,candidate,"Mister President, let me finish."
ROMNEY,145.3,time 2,candidate,I've gotta continue.
ROMNEY,146.1,time 3,candidate,because the private sector's not going to invest in a|
ROMNEY,147.1,time 2,candidate,Just going to make a point.
ROMNEY,147.2,time 2,candidate,Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.
ROMNEY,147.3,time 2,candidate,"And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in in Chinese companies."
ROMNEY,147.4,time 2,candidate,"Mister President, have you looked at your pension?"
ROMNEY,147.5,time 2,candidate,Have you looked at your pension?
ROMNEY,148.1,time 3,candidate,company|
ROMNEY,149.1,time 2,candidate,"Mister President, have you looked at your pension?"
ROMNEY,150.1,time 3,candidate,if if you're|
ROMNEY,151.1,time 2,candidate,"Well, let me give you some advice."
ROMNEY,152.1,time 3,candidate,get someone else's.
ROMNEY,153.1,time 2,candidate,Let me give you some advice.
ROMNEY,153.2,time 2,candidate,Look at your pension.
ROMNEY,153.3,time 2,candidate,You also have investments in Chinese companies.
ROMNEY,153.4,time 2,candidate,You also have investments outside the United States.
ROMNEY,153.5,time 2,candidate,You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.
ROMNEY,154.1,time 3,candidate,You're wrong|
ROMNEY,156.1,time 3,candidate,you're wrong.
ROMNEY,158.1,time 2,candidate,I'll get it done.
ROMNEY,158.1,time 3,candidate,"People can look it up, you're right."
ROMNEY,158.2,time 2,candidate,I'll get it done.
ROMNEY,158.3,time 2,candidate,First year|
ROMNEY,160.1,time 3,candidate,Good.
ROMNEY,162.1,time 3,candidate,"I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years."
ROMNEY,162.1,time 3,candidate,We're nine million jobs short of that.
ROMNEY,162.11,time 3,candidate,I've met some of those people.
ROMNEY,162.12,time 3,candidate,"I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin."
ROMNEY,162.13,time 3,candidate,"I met a young woman in in Philadelphia who's coming out of out of college, can't find work."
ROMNEY,162.14,time 3,candidate,I've been Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.
ROMNEY,162.15,time 3,candidate,"It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard."
ROMNEY,162.16,time 3,candidate,"And that's why it's so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy."
ROMNEY,162.17,time 3,candidate,And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers.
ROMNEY,162.18,time 3,candidate,"Look, I love to I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that."
ROMNEY,162.19,time 3,candidate,"By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools."
ROMNEY,162.2,time 3,candidate,"The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down dollar four thousand three hundred during your term."
ROMNEY,162.2,time 3,candidate,Let the states and localities do that.
ROMNEY,162.21,time 3,candidate,I was a governor.
ROMNEY,162.22,time 3,candidate,The federal government didn't hire our teachers.
ROMNEY,162.23,time 3,candidate,But I love teachers.
ROMNEY,162.24,time 3,candidate,But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.
ROMNEY,162.3,time 3,candidate,Twenty three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.
ROMNEY,162.4,time 3,candidate,When you came to office thirty two million people on food stamps.
ROMNEY,162.5,time 3,candidate,"Today, forty seven million people on food stamps."
ROMNEY,162.6,time 3,candidate,"When you came to office, just over dollar ten trillion in debt, now dollar sixteen trillion in debt."
ROMNEY,162.7,time 3,candidate,It hasn't worked.
ROMNEY,162.8,time 3,candidate,You said by now we'd be at five.
ROMNEY,162.9,time 3,candidate,four percent unemployment.
ROMNEY,166.1,time 3,candidate,Thank you.
ROMNEY,166.1,time 3,candidate,I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.
ROMNEY,166.11,time 3,candidate,And there are two very different paths the country can take.
ROMNEY,166.12,time 3,candidate,"One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have dollar twenty trillion in debt heading towards Greece."
ROMNEY,166.13,time 3,candidate,I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.
ROMNEY,166.14,time 3,candidate,The president's path will mean continuing declining in take home pay.
ROMNEY,166.15,time 3,candidate,I want to make sure our take home pay turns around and starts to grow.
ROMNEY,166.16,time 3,candidate,The president's path will mean continuing declining in take home pay.
ROMNEY,166.17,time 3,candidate,I want to make sure take home pay turns around and starts to grow.
ROMNEY,166.18,time 3,candidate,The president's path means twenty million people out of work struggling for a good job.
ROMNEY,166.19,time 3,candidate,I'll get people back to work with twelve million new jobs.
ROMNEY,166.2,time 3,candidate,"Bob, Mister President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you."
ROMNEY,166.2,time 3,candidate,"I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs."
ROMNEY,166.21,time 3,candidate,"America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle."
ROMNEY,166.22,time 3,candidate,I was in a state where my legislature was eighty seven percent Democrat.
ROMNEY,166.23,time 3,candidate,I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.
ROMNEY,166.24,time 3,candidate,We've got to do that in Washington.
ROMNEY,166.25,time 3,candidate,Washington is broken.
ROMNEY,166.26,time 3,candidate,"I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that."
ROMNEY,166.27,time 3,candidate,This nation is the hope of the earth.
ROMNEY,166.28,time 3,candidate,We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.
ROMNEY,166.29,time 3,candidate,They've held a torch for the world to see the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.
ROMNEY,166.3,time 3,candidate,I'm optimistic about the future.
ROMNEY,166.3,time 3,candidate,"Now, it's our turn to take that torch."
ROMNEY,166.31,time 3,candidate,I'm convinced we'll do it.
ROMNEY,166.32,time 3,candidate,We need strong leadership.
ROMNEY,166.33,time 3,candidate,I'd like to be that leader with your support.
ROMNEY,166.34,time 3,candidate,I'll work with you.
ROMNEY,166.35,time 3,candidate,"I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote."
ROMNEY,166.36,time 3,candidate,I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.
ROMNEY,166.37,time 3,candidate,Thank you so much.
ROMNEY,166.4,time 3,candidate,I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.
ROMNEY,166.5,time 3,candidate,I want to see peace.
ROMNEY,166.6,time 3,candidate,I want to see growing peace in this country.
ROMNEY,166.7,time 3,candidate,It's our objective.
ROMNEY,166.8,time 3,candidate,We have an opportunity to have real leadership.
ROMNEY,166.9,time 3,candidate,America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.
ROMNEY,173.1,time 2,candidate,"Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one."
ROMNEY,173.1,time 2,candidate,"Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration."
ROMNEY,173.11,time 2,candidate,How could we have not known?
ROMNEY,173.12,time 2,candidate,"But I find more troubling than this, that on on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since one thousand nine hundred seventy nine, when when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event."
ROMNEY,173.13,time 2,candidate,I think these these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.
ROMNEY,173.14,time 2,candidate,We've read their accounts now about what happened.
ROMNEY,173.15,time 2,candidate,It was very clear this was not a demonstration.
ROMNEY,173.16,time 2,candidate,This was an attack by terrorists.
ROMNEY,173.17,time 2,candidate,And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.
ROMNEY,173.18,time 2,candidate,"Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya."
ROMNEY,173.19,time 2,candidate,"Consider the distance between ourselves and and Israel, the president said that that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel."
ROMNEY,173.2,time 2,candidate,"And and I I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and and he takes responsibility for for that for the failure in providing those security resources, and and those terrible things may well happen from time to time."
ROMNEY,173.2,time 2,candidate,We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.
ROMNEY,173.21,time 2,candidate,"Syria Syria's not just a tragedy of thirty thousand civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic strategically significant player for America."
ROMNEY,173.22,time 2,candidate,"The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and and and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes."
ROMNEY,173.3,time 2,candidate,I I'm I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.
ROMNEY,173.4,time 2,candidate,And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.
ROMNEY,173.5,time 2,candidate,We we think of their families and care for them deeply.
ROMNEY,173.6,time 2,candidate,There were other issues associated with this with this tragedy.
ROMNEY,173.7,time 2,candidate,"There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack."
ROMNEY,173.8,time 2,candidate,And there was no demonstration involved.
ROMNEY,173.9,time 2,candidate,It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.
ROMNEY,177.1,time 2,candidate,"Yes, I I|"
ROMNEY,179.1,time 2,candidate,I I think interesting the president just said something which which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.
ROMNEY,181.1,time 2,candidate,"You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror."
ROMNEY,181.2,time 2,candidate,"It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?"
ROMNEY,183.1,time 2,candidate,I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president fourteen days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.
ROMNEY,188.1,time 2,candidate,This the administration the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.
ROMNEY,190.1,time 2,candidate,It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.
ROMNEY,190.2,time 2,candidate,"And to suggest am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the your secretary|"
ROMNEY,192.1,time 2,candidate,Excuse me.
ROMNEY,192.2,time 2,candidate,The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how|
ROMNEY,194.1,time 2,candidate,this was a spontaneous|
ROMNEY,209.1,time 2,candidate,"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal."
ROMNEY,223.1,time 2,candidate,"Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right."
ROMNEY,223.1,time 2,candidate,What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.
ROMNEY,223.11,time 2,candidate,This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.
ROMNEY,223.12,time 2,candidate,"It's not by trickle down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations."
ROMNEY,223.13,time 2,candidate,"Trickle down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere."
ROMNEY,223.14,time 2,candidate,"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America."
ROMNEY,223.15,time 2,candidate,"Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules."
ROMNEY,223.16,time 2,candidate,And China hasn't.
ROMNEY,223.17,time 2,candidate,One of the reasons or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.
ROMNEY,223.18,time 2,candidate,"Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low."
ROMNEY,223.19,time 2,candidate,And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.
ROMNEY,223.2,time 2,candidate,The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.
ROMNEY,223.2,time 2,candidate,We lose sales.
ROMNEY,223.21,time 2,candidate,And manufacturers here in the U.
ROMNEY,223.22,time 2,candidate,S.
ROMNEY,223.23,time 2,candidate,making the same products can't compete.
ROMNEY,223.24,time 2,candidate,China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.
ROMNEY,223.25,time 2,candidate,"And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so."
ROMNEY,223.26,time 2,candidate,"On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers."
ROMNEY,223.27,time 2,candidate,So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.
ROMNEY,223.28,time 2,candidate,But let me let me not just stop there.
ROMNEY,223.29,time 2,candidate,"Don't forget, what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they they follow the law and play by the rules, but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds."
ROMNEY,223.3,time 2,candidate,China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.
ROMNEY,223.3,time 2,candidate,"That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here."
ROMNEY,223.31,time 2,candidate,Canada's tax rate on companies is now fifteen percent.
ROMNEY,223.32,time 2,candidate,Ours is thirty five percent.
ROMNEY,223.33,time 2,candidate,"So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?"
ROMNEY,223.34,time 2,candidate,We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.
ROMNEY,223.35,time 2,candidate,Regulations have quadrupled.
ROMNEY,223.36,time 2,candidate,The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.
ROMNEY,223.37,time 2,candidate,I talk to small businesses across the country.
ROMNEY,223.38,time 2,candidate,"They say, We feel like we're under attack from our own government."
ROMNEY,223.39,time 2,candidate,"I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it."
ROMNEY,223.4,time 2,candidate,It used to be the United States of America.
ROMNEY,223.4,time 2,candidate,And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.
ROMNEY,223.41,time 2,candidate,My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.
ROMNEY,223.42,time 2,candidate,"If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again."
ROMNEY,223.43,time 2,candidate,The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.
ROMNEY,223.44,time 2,candidate,"I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules."
ROMNEY,223.5,time 2,candidate,A lot of good people have lost jobs.
ROMNEY,223.6,time 2,candidate,A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.
ROMNEY,223.7,time 2,candidate,That's total over the last four years.
ROMNEY,223.8,time 2,candidate,One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.
ROMNEY,223.9,time 2,candidate,We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.
ROMNEY,227.1,time 2,candidate,The answer is very straightforward.
ROMNEY,227.1,time 2,candidate,That's what brings jobs in.
ROMNEY,227.11,time 2,candidate,The president's characterization of my tax plan|
ROMNEY,227.12,time 2,candidate,is completely|
ROMNEY,227.13,time 2,candidate,is completely|
ROMNEY,227.14,time 2,candidate,is completely false.
ROMNEY,227.15,time 2,candidate,Let me tell you|
ROMNEY,227.2,time 2,candidate,We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.
ROMNEY,227.3,time 2,candidate,China's been cheating over the years.
ROMNEY,227.4,time 2,candidate,One by holding down the value of their currency.
ROMNEY,227.5,time 2,candidate,"Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology."
ROMNEY,227.6,time 2,candidate,"There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods."
ROMNEY,227.7,time 2,candidate,They hack into our computers.
ROMNEY,227.8,time 2,candidate,"We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one."
ROMNEY,227.9,time 2,candidate,"Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business."
ROMNEY,231.1,time 2,candidate,Government does not create jobs.
ROMNEY,231.2,time 2,candidate,Government does not create jobs.
ROMNEY,233.1,time 2,candidate,Barry?
ROMNEY,233.2,time 2,candidate,Where is Barry?
ROMNEY,235.1,time 2,candidate,"Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it."
ROMNEY,235.1,time 2,candidate,My my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God.
ROMNEY,235.11,time 2,candidate,And I believe we're all children of the same God.
ROMNEY,235.12,time 2,candidate,I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.
ROMNEY,235.13,time 2,candidate,I I served as a missionary for my church.
ROMNEY,235.14,time 2,candidate,I served as a pastor in my congregation for about ten years.
ROMNEY,235.15,time 2,candidate,I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.
ROMNEY,235.16,time 2,candidate,I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.
ROMNEY,235.17,time 2,candidate,"And as governor of my state, I was able to get one hundred percent of my people insured, all my kids, about ninety eight percent of the adults."
ROMNEY,235.18,time 2,candidate,"I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so one hundred percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future."
ROMNEY,235.19,time 2,candidate,I understand that I can get this country on track again.
ROMNEY,235.2,time 2,candidate,"In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do."
ROMNEY,235.2,time 2,candidate,We don't have to settle for what we're going through.
ROMNEY,235.21,time 2,candidate,We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.
ROMNEY,235.22,time 2,candidate,We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level.
ROMNEY,235.23,time 2,candidate,We don't have to settle for forty seven million people on food stamps.
ROMNEY,235.24,time 2,candidate,We don't have to settle for fifty percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.
ROMNEY,235.25,time 2,candidate,We don't have to settle for twenty three million people struggling to find a good job.
ROMNEY,235.26,time 2,candidate,"If I become president, I'll get America working again."
ROMNEY,235.27,time 2,candidate,I will get us on track to a balanced budget.
ROMNEY,235.28,time 2,candidate,The president hasn't.
ROMNEY,235.29,time 2,candidate,I will.
ROMNEY,235.3,time 2,candidate,"In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as as someone who's very different than who I am."
ROMNEY,235.3,time 2,candidate,I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming coming generations.
ROMNEY,235.31,time 2,candidate,The president said he would.
ROMNEY,235.32,time 2,candidate,He didn't.
ROMNEY,235.4,time 2,candidate,I care about one hundred percent of the American people.
ROMNEY,235.5,time 2,candidate,I want one hundred percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.
ROMNEY,235.6,time 2,candidate,I care about our kids.
ROMNEY,235.7,time 2,candidate,I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.
ROMNEY,235.8,time 2,candidate,"I spent my life in the private sector, not in government."
ROMNEY,235.9,time 2,candidate,"I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people."
ROMNEY,237.1,time 2,candidate,I'll get our incomes up.
ROMNEY,237.2,time 2,candidate,"And by the way, I've done these things."
ROMNEY,237.3,time 2,candidate,I served as governor and showed I could get them done.
